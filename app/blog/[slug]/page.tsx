<p>Welcome to my comprehensive guide on building a Security Operations Center (SOC) automation lab environment from scratch. This project documents my journey in creating a fully functional SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) setup using tools like Wazuh, The Hive, and Shuffle.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>As a cybersecurity enthusiast and aspiring SOC analyst, I've embarked on this project to gain hands-on experience with real-world SOC tools and workflows. The goal is to create a practical environment for learning and experimenting with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security event monitoring and collection</li>
<li>Alert management and enrichment</li>
<li>Automated response actions</li>
<li>Case management and documentation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Components</h2>

<h3>1. Infrastructure Planning</h3>

<p>The first phase involved careful planning of the lab infrastructure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Designing the network architecture</li>
<li>Selecting appropriate tools and technologies</li>
<li>Planning data flows between components</li>
<li>Establishing security controls</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Tool Selection and Setup</h3>

<p>For this project, I chose the following tools:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Wazuh</strong>: For security monitoring and event collection
<ul>
<li>Host-based intrusion detection</li>
<li>File integrity monitoring</li>
<li>Log analysis and alerting</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>The Hive</strong>: For case management
<ul>
<li>Alert triage and investigation</li>
<li>Case tracking and documentation</li>
<li>Team collaboration features</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Shuffle</strong>: For automation and orchestration
<ul>
<li>Workflow automation</li>
<li>Alert enrichment</li>
<li>Integration between tools</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Implementation Steps</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Initial Setup</h3>

<p>The first step involved setting up the basic infrastructure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creating virtual machines</li>
<li>Configuring network settings</li>
<li>Installing base operating systems</li>
<li>Setting up security controls</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 2: Wazuh Deployment</h3>

<p>Next, I focused on deploying Wazuh:</p>

<ol>
<li>Installing Wazuh server</li>
<li>Configuring agents</li>
<li>Setting up basic detection rules</li>
<li>Testing event collection</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 3: The Hive Integration</h3>

<p>The case management system was then integrated:</p>

<ol>
<li>Installing The Hive</li>
<li>Configuring alert sources</li>
<li>Setting up case templates</li>
<li>Testing alert to case conversion</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 4: Automation with Shuffle</h3>

<p>Finally, I implemented automation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creating workflows in Shuffle</li>
<li>Setting up tool integrations</li>
<li>Implementing alert enrichment</li>
<li>Testing automated responses</li>
</ol>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights:</p>

<ol>
<li>The importance of proper planning before implementation</li>
<li>The complexity of tool integration in a SOC environment</li>
<li>The value of automation in reducing manual tasks</li>
<li>The need for continuous testing and refinement</li>
</ol>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>

<p>I plan to enhance this setup with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Additional data sources</li>
<li>Custom detection rules</li>
<li>More automated workflows</li>
<li>Threat intelligence integration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This project has been an invaluable learning experience, providing hands-on exposure to real-world SOC tools and workflows. It serves as a foundation for further experimentation and skill development in security operations.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for detailed posts about each phase of the implementation!</p>
