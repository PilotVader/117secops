### Step 1: Define Your Culture Goals

Start by aligning security goals with business objectives. Identify key outcomes, such as reduced phishing click rates or faster incident reporting.

### Step 2: Implement Ongoing Security Training

Move beyond annual training. Use short, engaging modules and phishing simulations throughout the year to reinforce learning.

### Step 3: Reward Secure Behavior

Celebrate employees who report suspicious activity or go above and beyond to follow security best practices.

### Step 4: Build Psychological Safety

Employees should feel safe reporting security mistakes or asking questions—without fear of punishment.

### Step 5: Measure and Iterate

Use metrics like reporting rates, quiz scores, and incident trends to evaluate and refine your program regularly.
