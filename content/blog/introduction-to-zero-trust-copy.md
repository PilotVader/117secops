# Introduction to Zero Trust Architecture

Zero Trust is a security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside their perimeters and instead must verify anything and everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access.

## Core Principles of Zero Trust

1. **Verify explicitly**: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
2. **Use least privilege access**: Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA).
3. **Assume breach**: Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to improve defenses.

## Implementing Zero Trust in Your Organization

### Step 1: Identify Your Protect Surface

The protect surface contains the most critical and valuable data, assets, applications, and services (DAAS) to your organization. Unlike the attack surface, which is potentially massive, the protect surface is orders of magnitude smaller.

### Step 2: Map Transaction Flows

Understand how traffic moves across your network. Determine how specific resources interact with other resources on your network.

### Step 3: Design a Zero Trust Architecture

Build a Zero Trust architecture, starting with a Next-Generation Firewall as your microperimeter enforcement point.

### Step 4: Create Zero Trust Policies

Create policies that determine who can access specific resources under what circumstances. The Kipling Method (who, what, when, where, why, and how) is useful for creating these policies.

### Step 5: Monitor and Maintain

Zero Trust is an iterative process. Continuously monitor all logs and traffic, looking for anomalous or malicious activity.

## Benefits of Zero Trust

- Reduced risk of data breaches
- Improved visibility into network traffic
- Better control over access to sensitive resources
- Simplified security infrastructure
- Enhanced compliance posture

## Conclusion

Implementing Zero Trust is not a one-time project but a journey that requires ongoing attention and refinement. By starting with your most critical assets and gradually expanding your Zero Trust architecture, you can significantly improve your organization's security posture.
