# SOC Automation Project: Building a Home Lab Environment

Welcome to my comprehensive guide on building a Security Operations Center (SOC) automation lab environment from scratch. This project documents my journey in creating a fully functional SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) setup using tools like Wazuh, The Hive, and Shuffle.

## Project Overview

As a cybersecurity enthusiast and aspiring SOC analyst, I've embarked on this project to gain hands-on experience with real-world SOC tools and workflows. The goal is to create a practical environment for learning and experimenting with:

- Security event monitoring and collection
- Alert management and enrichment
- Automated response actions
- Case management and documentation

## Project Components

### 1. Infrastructure Planning

The first phase involved careful planning of the lab infrastructure:

- Designing the network architecture
- Selecting appropriate tools and technologies
- Planning data flows between components
- Establishing security controls

### 2. Tool Selection and Setup

For this project, I chose the following tools:

1. **Wazuh**: For security monitoring and event collection
   - Host-based intrusion detection
   - File integrity monitoring
   - Log analysis and alerting

2. **The Hive**: For case management
   - Alert triage and investigation
   - Case tracking and documentation
   - Team collaboration features

3. **Shuffle**: For automation and orchestration
   - Workflow automation
   - Alert enrichment
   - Integration between tools

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Initial Setup

The first step involved setting up the basic infrastructure:

1. Creating virtual machines
2. Configuring network settings
3. Installing base operating systems
4. Setting up security controls

### Step 2: Wazuh Deployment

Next, I focused on deploying Wazuh:

1. Installing Wazuh server
2. Configuring agents
3. Setting up basic detection rules
4. Testing event collection

### Step 3: The Hive Integration

The case management system was then integrated:

1. Installing The Hive
2. Configuring alert sources
3. Setting up case templates
4. Testing alert to case conversion

### Step 4: Automation with Shuffle

Finally, I implemented automation:

1. Creating workflows in Shuffle
2. Setting up tool integrations
3. Implementing alert enrichment
4. Testing automated responses

## Lessons Learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights:

1. The importance of proper planning before implementation
2. The complexity of tool integration in a SOC environment
3. The value of automation in reducing manual tasks
4. The need for continuous testing and refinement

## Future Enhancements

I plan to enhance this setup with:

- Additional data sources
- Custom detection rules
- More automated workflows
- Threat intelligence integration

## Conclusion

This project has been an invaluable learning experience, providing hands-on exposure to real-world SOC tools and workflows. It serves as a foundation for further experimentation and skill development in security operations.

Stay tuned for detailed posts about each phase of the implementation!
