# Introduction to the 30-Days MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge

I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be taking on the 30-Days MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge! If you're like me, eager to gain hands-on experience in cybersecurity, this challenge is a perfect opportunity.

Over the next 30 days, I'll be learning how to set up and configure the ELK Stack, investigate security incidents, and create dashboards and alerts. Each week focuses on a specific skill, from brute force attack detection to setting up a C2 server.

This challenge is all about turning theory into practice, and by the end, I'll have honed the skills that are crucial for a SOC analyst role. I'll be sharing my progress and insights along the way, so stay tuned for updates.

Join me on this journey as I aim to strengthen my skills and prepare for the real-world demands of cybersecurity. Let's get started!
