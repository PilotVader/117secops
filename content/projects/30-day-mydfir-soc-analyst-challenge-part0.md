# Introduction to the 30-Days MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge

I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be taking on the 30-Days MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge! If you're like me—eager to gain hands-on experience in cybersecurity—this challenge is a perfect opportunity.

Over the next 30 days, I'll be learning how to:
- Set up and configure the ELK Stack
- Investigate security incidents
- Create dashboards and alerts
- And much more!

Each week focuses on a specific skill, from brute force attack detection to setting up a C2 server.

This challenge is all about turning theory into practice, and by the end, I'll have honed the skills that are crucial for a SOC analyst role. I'll be sharing my progress and insights along the way, so stay tuned for updates.

Join me on this journey as I aim to strengthen my skills and prepare for the real-world demands of cybersecurity. Let's get started!
