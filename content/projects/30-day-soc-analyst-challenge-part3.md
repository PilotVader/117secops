# Day 3 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Setting up Elastic Search

## Overview

The focus for today was on setting up my own Elastic Search instance, following practical steps to build a foundational environment for security analysis.

## Cloud Environment Setup

First, I signed up on Vultr, a cloud service provider, which was used to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. To avoid connectivity issues, I ensured that all resources, including virtual machines (VMs), were in the same location as my VPC. For instance, I created the VPC in Manchester, so I deployed my VM in the same region.

After configuring my VPC, I deployed a server on Vultr with Ubuntu as the operating system. The server had 4 virtual CPUs and 16 GB of RAM to run Elastic Search. I opted out of unnecessary features like auto-backups and IPv6, keeping the setup streamlined, I then associated the VM with my VPC network to ensure it could communicate internally.

## Elastic Search Installation

Next, I accessed the server via SSH, using PowerShell to connect to my VM through its public IP address. Inside the VM, I updated the repositories and installed Elastic Search. During the installation, I was provided with critical security information, including a password for the built-in superuser account. I stored this information securely for future reference.

## Security Configuration

One essential step was configuring Elastic Search to be accessible beyond the local host. By modifying the network settings in the elasticsearch.yml configuration file, I allowed remote access from my SOC analyst laptop, making sure it was securely configured.

To tighten security, I created a firewall group in Vultr, limiting access to only trusted IP addresses, in this case, I gave access to my IP alone. This ensured that only authorized connections could reach the Elastic Search instance.

## Final Steps

Finally, I started the Elastic Search service and confirmed it was running smoothly. This marked the completion of setting up the Elastic Search instance, laying the groundwork for the next stepâ€”configuring Kibana, the visualization tool for Elastic Search.
