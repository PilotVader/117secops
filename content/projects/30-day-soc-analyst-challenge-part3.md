## Introduction

In Part 3 of our SOC Analyst Challenge, we'll focus on setting up Elasticsearch, the powerful search and analytics engine at the core of our security monitoring solution. We'll cover installation, configuration, and security best practices.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:
- A Linux server (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended)
- Minimum 8GB RAM
- 4 CPU cores
- 50GB storage
- Root or sudo access

## Installation Steps

1. System Preparation
   - Update system packages
   - Install Java requirements
   - Configure system limits

2. Elasticsearch Installation
   - Add Elasticsearch repository
   - Install Elasticsearch package
   - Configure service settings

3. Basic Configuration
   - Network settings
   - Node configuration
   - Memory allocation
   - Path settings

## Security Configuration

1. Security Features
   - Enable X-Pack security
   - SSL/TLS configuration
   - User authentication setup
   - Role-based access control

2. Network Security
   - Firewall configuration
   - Network binding
   - Transport layer security

## Performance Tuning

1. Memory Settings
   - JVM heap size
   - Memory lock configuration
   - Garbage collection settings

2. Index Settings
   - Sharding strategy
   - Replication configuration
   - Index lifecycle management

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Health Checks
   - Cluster health monitoring
   - Node status checks
   - Index health verification

2. Backup Strategy
   - Snapshot configuration
   - Backup scheduling
   - Recovery testing

## Validation and Testing

- Cluster health verification
- Basic CRUD operations
- Search functionality testing
- Security control validation

## Next Steps

In Part 4, we'll set up Kibana and connect it to our Elasticsearch instance, creating our first security dashboards and visualizations. We'll also explore how to effectively use Kibana for security monitoring and analysis.

Stay tuned as we continue building our security monitoring infrastructure!
