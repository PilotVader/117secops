# Introduction

Having already gained hands-on experience through my personal cybersecurity projects and previous professional engagements, I am always looking for opportunities to broaden my exposure to enterprise-grade tools and real-world SOC environments. Over the past few months, I have worked extensively on my home lab, documented multiple projects, and sharpened my skills across areas such as SIEM, incident response, and vulnerability management. However, I wanted to push further, especially into the Microsoft security ecosystem, while also gaining structured exposure to premium enterprise tools.

That is why I enrolled in the Cyber Range internship program. This platform is built around Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Sentinel, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, combined with Tenable for enterprise vulnerability management. It provides a collaborative SOC-like environment where hundreds of analysts work within shared infrastructure that is constantly being targeted by real-world malicious activity. For me, this is not just about learning the basics, it is about refining my skills, testing myself in a live environment, and building familiarity with tools that are at the core of modern enterprise security operations.

## Getting Started and Building the Foundation

The first step in this journey is orientation. The Cyber Range platform begins with a structured roadmap that sets expectations for consistency and growth. Every participant is encouraged to treat it like a real job environment, logging in daily, building habits, and steadily improving. I will begin by following this roadmap, which introduces both theory and practice.

In these early weeks, I will revisit fundamental cybersecurity concepts, particularly those aligned with frameworks and compliance regulations. For example, I'll explore how frameworks like NIST or ISO provide the backbone for security controls, and how compliance drivers such as HIPAA or GDPR influence day-to-day security operations. These sessions will serve as a refresher and prepare me for the more technical modules that follow, while also sharpening my understanding of how policy connects to practice.

## Vulnerability Management with Tenable

The first major technical module focuses on vulnerability management, an essential discipline in any cybersecurity program. Using Tenable, I will learn how to scan systems for weaknesses, interpret the findings, and take steps toward remediation.

This will involve setting up and running vulnerability scans on virtual machines inside the shared Azure environment, examining the results, and applying patches or configuration changes to reduce risk. For example, if a scan reveals outdated services or missing patches, I'll work through the remediation process just as I would in a real enterprise. Over the coming weeks, my goal is to treat this module not as a checklist, but as a chance to build a workflow: from detection to prioritization, to resolution, and finally verification. Documenting these workflows will be an important part of this project.

## Threat Hunting, Security Operations, and Incident Response

The second technical phase immerses me in the SOC workflow. Here, I will be working with Microsoft Sentinel as the SIEM platform, Defender for Endpoint as the EDR solution, and real log data generated by hundreds of users and systems in the Cyber Range.

This is where theory meets practice. Over the next few weeks, I will analyze log flows, craft queries, investigate anomalies, and conduct basic threat hunting. Since the environment is live and exposed to the internet, there will be real attempts by malicious actors to probe and exploit systems. My task will be to detect these attempts, understand their tactics, and respond effectively.

I will also practice structured incident response. For example, if suspicious activity is detected on a virtual machine, I'll follow response steps: confirming the event, containing the activity, investigating root cause, and documenting lessons learned. This experience mirrors the responsibilities of a SOC analyst and will be central to my learning and documentation.

## From Learning to Internship Experience

Beyond the technical labs, the Cyber Range includes a formal internship component. As I progress, I will take on specific tasks that count toward this internship, such as vulnerability scans, incident investigations, and security monitoring activities. Each completed task adds to my record of experience, which can be verified by employers.

This part of the program is significant because it transforms the learning journey into something that can be added to a CV and LinkedIn profile as real internship experience. Over the next few weeks, I will treat these tasks as milestones, carefully documenting what I did, how I approached the problem, and what the outcomes were. This will not only strengthen my portfolio but also demonstrate a clear path of professional growth.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Project 5 marks an exciting phase in my cybersecurity journey. Unlike previous projects that focused on building my personal lab, this one places me directly inside a live, collaborative SOC-like environment where the stakes feel real and the tools mirror what enterprises use daily.

Over the next few weeks, I will document every stage of this process: from foundational refreshers to vulnerability management, from SOC threat hunting to structured incident response, even blogging about theoretical concepts I learn from the platform and finally the internship validation itself. Each update will be posted on this site, showcasing not just the technical steps but also the reflections, challenges, and lessons learned along the way.

The ultimate goal is to come out of this experience with practical, verifiable internship experience, sharpened SOC skills, and a portfolio that speaks directly to the expectations of employers. By treating this journey seriously and documenting it transparently, I hope to bridge the gap between learning and professional practice, one step at a time.
