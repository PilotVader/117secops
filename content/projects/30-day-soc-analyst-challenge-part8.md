## Day 8 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Sysmon

Day 8 of the 30-day My DFIR SOC Analyst Challenge focuses on improving endpoint visibility using Sysmon (System Monitor). Sysmon is a powerful tool from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite that provides detailed logging capabilities, such as tracking process creation, network connections, and file modifications—critical for effective incident response and threat detection.

## Understanding Sysmon's Role

The default logging settings in Windows are insufficient for capturing vital events like process creations. Sysmon fills this gap, offering extensive telemetry that enhances my ability to detect and investigate malicious activities. With Sysmon, I can track important event IDs, such as:

## Key Event IDs and Their Significance

Event ID 1 (Process Creation): Logs any new processes, along with their command lines, which helps identify suspicious activities. It also records file hashes for further analysis.

Event ID 3 (Network Connections): Logs details of network connections made by processes, including source and destination IP addresses, and ports—useful for spotting unusual outbound connections.

Event IDs 6, 7, 8 (Driver, Image Load, Create Remote Thread): These event IDs help detect advanced attack techniques, like process injection but can generate noise, so proper filtering is essential.

Event ID 10 (Process Access): Monitors potential credential access attempts, especially against critical processes like LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service), which attackers often target to extract credentials.

Event ID 22 (DNS Query): Tracks DNS requests made by endpoints, allowing me to detect suspicious domain lookups, such as those generated by malware using domain generation algorithms (DGA).

## Configuration Considerations

While Sysmon greatly enhances visibility, it's crucial to fine-tune the configuration to balance logging depth with noise reduction. I'll learn how to install and configure Sysmon in future sessions to optimize my endpoint monitoring capabilities. This step is vital for elevating my skills in threat detection and incident response within a SOC environment.

## Conclusion

The next phase of the challenge will guide me through installing Sysmon with a recommended configuration to start analyzing Sysmon logs and improve my cybersecurity analysis proficiency.
