## Introduction

In Part 8 of our SOC Analyst Challenge, we'll explore System Monitor (Sysmon), a powerful Windows system service that monitors and logs system activity to the Windows event log. Understanding Sysmon is crucial for effective security monitoring.

## What is Sysmon?

1. Overview
   - Purpose and functionality
   - Key features
   - Advantages over standard Windows logging
   - Use cases in security monitoring

2. Architecture
   - System service
   - Event logging mechanism
   - Integration points
   - Performance impact

## Event Types

1. Process Events
   - Process creation/termination
   - Process access
   - Image loading
   - Command line logging

2. Network Events
   - Network connections
   - DNS queries
   - Named pipe activity
   - Raw access reads

3. File System Events
   - File creation
   - File stream creation
   - File deletion
   - File timestamps

4. Registry Events
   - Registry object creation/deletion
   - Registry value sets
   - Registry key/value renaming
   - Registry access

## Configuration

1. XML Configuration
   - Basic structure
   - Rule types
   - Filtering options
   - Include/exclude rules

2. Best Practices
   - Performance optimization
   - Rule organization
   - Maintenance strategies
   - Version control

## Security Considerations

1. Deployment Planning
   - System requirements
   - Network impact
   - Storage requirements
   - Performance considerations

2. Threat Detection
   - Common attack patterns
   - Suspicious behaviors
   - False positive handling
   - Alert prioritization

## Next Steps

In Part 9, we'll perform hands-on installation and configuration of Sysmon on our Windows Server, integrating it with our existing monitoring infrastructure.

Stay tuned as we enhance our security monitoring capabilities with detailed system-level visibility!
