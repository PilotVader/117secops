# Project 1: Building a Cybersecurity Home Lab

## Part 1: Home Lab Setup

I embarked on an exciting journey to establish a cybersecurity home lab aimed at creating a controlled environment for hands-on experimentation and skill development.

### Setting Up Virtual Machines

To begin, I chose VirtualBox as my virtualization platform, which allows me to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) for specific tasks. I set up two VMs: one running Parrot Security OS, favored for penetration testing, and another with Windows for defensive security tasks and telemetry generation.

Creating the virtual machines was straightforward. I allocated sufficient resources, including CPU and RAM, to ensure optimal performance. For Parrot Security OS, I configured the network settings to facilitate communication with the Windows machine. By selecting an Internal Network type, I established a private network between the VMs, isolating my lab from the internet and reducing the risk of exposure during testing.

### Setting Up Sysmon for Telemetry Generation

To enhance telemetry on the Windows machine, I installed Sysmon (System Monitor), a tool that logs detailed system activity. After downloading Sysmon from the Microsoft Sysinternals website, I executed it with a configuration to capture key events, including process creation and network connections. This setup allows effective monitoring and analysis of activities, providing rich telemetry data for examination.

### Integrating Splunk for Analysis

Next, I installed Splunk on the Windows VM to analyze the telemetry data generated by Sysmon. Splunk is a powerful platform for searching and analyzing machine-generated data, essential for incident response. After installation, I configured Splunk to ingest the Sysmon logs by setting up a new data input and specifying the log directory. Initial searches confirmed that Splunk was capturing the data correctly.

With Sysmon and Splunk operational, my telemetry generation setup was complete, enabling analysis of security events and improving my skills in detecting and responding to potential threats.

### Testing Connectivity

After the VMs were running, I conducted connectivity tests using basic network commands like PING to ensure effective communication between them. This step confirmed that my network configuration was functioning as intended, allowing seamless data sharing. Establishing this successful connection provided a sense of accomplishment, laying the groundwork for exploring various cybersecurity tools and techniques in a controlled environment.

## Conclusion

With the initial setup complete, I now have a solid foundation for my cybersecurity home lab. This environment will provide hands-on experience and help develop the skills necessary for my future as a SOC analyst. In the next part of this blog, I will explore generating telemetry data and analyzing it to uncover valuable security insights.

Stay Tuned!
