## Introduction

In Part 4 of our SOC Analyst Challenge, we'll set up Kibana, the visualization and management interface for our Elasticsearch deployment. We'll learn how to create effective security dashboards and configure Kibana for optimal security monitoring.

## Prerequisites

- Elasticsearch installed and running
- Web server (nginx/apache) for reverse proxy (optional)
- SSL certificate (recommended)
- Basic understanding of web interfaces

## Installation Process

1. Initial Setup
   - Install Kibana package
   - Configure Elasticsearch connection
   - Set up system service
   - Configure memory settings

2. Basic Configuration
   - Server settings
   - Elasticsearch connection
   - Security settings
   - Logging configuration

## Security Configuration

1. Authentication Setup
   - Enable security features
   - Create admin users
   - Configure role-based access
   - Set up SSO (optional)

2. Network Security
   - Configure SSL/TLS
   - Set up reverse proxy
   - IP filtering
   - Session management

## Dashboard Creation

1. Security Dashboards
   - Overview dashboard
   - Alert monitoring
   - System metrics
   - Security events

2. Visualization Types
   - Time series graphs
   - Pie charts
   - Heat maps
   - Data tables
   - Metric visualizations

## Index Pattern Configuration

1. Setup
   - Create index patterns
   - Configure field mappings
   - Set up runtime fields
   - Define data views

2. Management
   - Field formatting
   - Scripted fields
   - Index aliases
   - Pattern optimization

## Alert Configuration

1. Basic Alerts
   - Threshold alerts
   - Query-based alerts
   - Metric alerts
   - Status alerts

2. Alert Management
   - Notification channels
   - Alert scheduling
   - Action types
   - Alert tracking

## Next Steps

In Part 5, we'll focus on deploying Windows Server in the cloud, which will serve as one of our primary log sources. We'll configure it to forward logs to our ELK Stack and create specific dashboards for Windows event monitoring.

Stay tuned as we continue expanding our security monitoring capabilities!
