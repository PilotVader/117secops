## Introduction

In Part 5 of our SOC Analyst Challenge, we'll deploy a Windows Server in the cloud. This server will serve as a critical component in our security monitoring infrastructure, providing Windows event logs and serving as a target for testing security monitoring scenarios.

## Cloud Platform Selection

We'll use Microsoft Azure for our deployment, but the concepts apply to other cloud providers:
- Azure Portal setup
- Subscription management
- Resource group creation
- Network configuration

## Windows Server Setup

1. Instance Configuration
   - Selecting the right VM size
   - Operating system version
   - Storage configuration
   - Network settings

2. Security Configuration
   - Network Security Groups
   - Windows Firewall rules
   - Remote access setup
   - Update management

## Network Configuration

1. Virtual Network Setup
   - Subnet configuration
   - IP addressing
   - DNS settings
   - Network security

2. Connectivity
   - Remote Desktop access
   - VPN configuration
   - Internal network routing
   - Security group rules

## Security Hardening

1. Base Security Settings
   - Windows security baseline
   - Password policies
   - Account restrictions
   - Service hardening

2. Monitoring Configuration
   - Event log settings
   - Audit policies
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security monitoring

## Integration with ELK Stack

1. Log Forwarding Setup
   - Windows Event Forwarding
   - Sysmon installation
   - Elastic Agent deployment
   - Log shipping configuration

2. Log Collection
   - Event log channels
   - Custom log sources
   - Forwarding rules
   - Performance optimization

## Validation and Testing

1. Connectivity Tests
   - Network access
   - Log forwarding
   - Remote management
   - Security controls

2. Monitoring Verification
   - Event collection
   - Log parsing
   - Dashboard updates
   - Alert triggering

## Next Steps

In Part 6, we'll focus on centralized management with Fleet Server and Elastic Agent, building upon our Windows Server deployment to create a comprehensive log collection infrastructure.

Stay tuned as we continue enhancing our security monitoring capabilities!
