## Introduction

Today marks the beginning of our hands-on journey in the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge. We're starting with the most fundamental aspect: creating a logical network diagram that will serve as the blueprint for our entire SOC environment.

## Environment Overview

At the heart of our SOC environment lies a carefully planned infrastructure consisting of six key servers. The core components include our Elastic Server for comprehensive log aggregation and analysis, paired with a Kibana Server that handles visualization and dashboard creation. To manage our agents effectively, we've incorporated a Fleet Server into the design. Additionally, a C2 Server has been included to facilitate realistic attack scenario simulations, alongside other supporting infrastructure components that complete our robust environment.

## Implementation Details

The implementation process began with draw.io as our diagramming tool of choice. Through careful consideration, we mapped out the complete environment with attention to detail. The process involved strategic placement of each server component within the network topology, ensuring optimal communication paths. We dedicated significant attention to configuring the private network structure and establishing clear data flow connections between components. Special consideration was given to defining security zones and boundaries, ensuring a secure and well-organized infrastructure.

## Key Insights

Through the process of creating this network diagram, we've gained valuable insights into the practical aspects of SOC architecture. Understanding how components interact within a security operations environment has proven crucial, as this setup mirrors real-world scenarios. The exercise has deepened our understanding of data flow patterns and the importance of comprehensive security monitoring coverage. This foundation will prove invaluable as we progress through the challenge.

## Future Direction

While this network diagram may appear straightforward, it represents the cornerstone of our 30-day journey. This blueprint will guide us through the configuration of monitoring tools, implementation of log forwarding mechanisms, and setup of alert management systems. As we progress, we'll use this foundation to simulate and detect security threats, turning theoretical knowledge into practical experience.
