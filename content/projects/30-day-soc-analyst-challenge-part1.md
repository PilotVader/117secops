Today, I kicked off the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge by building the foundation of my environment—a logical network diagram. Using draw.io, I mapped out six key servers, including Elastic and Kibana for monitoring, a Fleet server, and a C2 server. These components will allow me to simulate real-world SOC activities, from log forwarding to alert management.

The process involved selecting and arranging server icons, defining a private network, and setting up connections representing how data flows across the system. One key takeaway is the importance of understanding how these components interact—this setup mirrors what happens in a real security operations environment.
Through this exercise, I've reinforced my understanding of architecting a secure, functional SOC environment. As I move forward, I'll dive deeper into configuring and utilizing these tools. The diagram might seem basic, but it's the blueprint that will guide everything I'll be doing over the next month.
This setup not only gives structure to my learning but also ensures I can monitor, detect, and respond to threats just like a SOC analyst would. It's a critical step in turning theory into hands-on experience.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue this journey, and if you're following along, get ready to take your cybersecurity skills to the next level!
