## Introduction

In this first part of our 30-day SOC Analyst Challenge, we'll focus on creating a logical network diagram that will serve as the foundation for our security monitoring environment. A well-designed network diagram is crucial for understanding data flow, identifying potential security gaps, and planning effective monitoring strategies.

## What We'll Cover

- Understanding the components of a SOC environment
- Creating a logical network diagram using industry-standard tools
- Documenting network segments and security zones
- Planning log collection points and monitoring coverage

## Key Components

Our network diagram will include:

1. Network Segments
   - DMZ
   - Internal Network
   - Management Network
   - Security Tools Network

2. Security Components
   - Firewalls
   - IDS/IPS Systems
   - Log Collectors
   - SIEM Platform (ELK Stack)

3. Endpoints and Servers
   - Windows Servers
   - Linux Servers
   - Workstations
   - Security Tools

## Tools We'll Use

- Draw.io (or Diagrams.net) for network diagramming
- Microsoft Visio (alternative)
- Industry-standard network icons and symbols

## Best Practices

1. Use clear and consistent labeling
2. Include IP addressing schemes
3. Document security zones and boundaries
4. Show data flow directions
5. Include monitoring points

## Next Steps

In Part 2, we'll build upon this foundation by diving into the ELK Stack, which will serve as our central security monitoring platform. The network diagram we create here will help us understand where to place our log collectors and how to structure our monitoring architecture.

Stay tuned as we continue our journey to build a comprehensive security monitoring environment!
