## Introduction

Today marks the beginning of my hands-on journey in the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge. I'm starting with the most fundamental aspect: creating a logical network diagram that will serve as the blueprint for my entire SOC environment.



## Environment Overview

At the heart of my SOC environment lies a carefully planned infrastructure consisting of six key servers. The core components include my Elastic Server for comprehensive log aggregation and analysis, paired with a Kibana Server that handles visualization and dashboard creation. To manage my agents effectively, I've incorporated a Fleet Server into the design. Additionally, a C2 Server has been included to facilitate realistic attack scenario simulations, alongside other supporting infrastructure components that complete my robust environment.

## Implementation Details

The implementation process began with draw.io as my diagramming tool of choice. Through careful consideration, I mapped out the complete environment with attention to detail. The process involved strategic placement of each server component within the network topology, ensuring optimal communication paths. I dedicated significant attention to configuring the private network structure and establishing clear data flow connections between components. Special consideration was given to defining security zones and boundaries, ensuring a secure and well-organized infrastructure.

## Key Insights

Through the process of creating this network diagram, I've gained valuable insights into the practical aspects of SOC architecture. Understanding how components interact within a security operations environment has proven crucial, as this setup mirrors real-world scenarios. The exercise has deepened my understanding of data flow patterns and the importance of comprehensive security monitoring coverage. This foundation will prove invaluable as I progress through the challenge.

## Future Direction

While this network diagram may appear straightforward, it represents the cornerstone of my 30-day journey. This blueprint will guide me through the configuration of monitoring tools, implementation of log forwarding mechanisms, and setup of alert management systems. As I progress, I'll use this foundation to simulate and detect security threats, turning theoretical knowledge into practical experience.
