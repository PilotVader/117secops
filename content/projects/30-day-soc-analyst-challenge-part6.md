## Introduction

In Part 6 of our SOC Analyst Challenge, we'll explore Fleet Server and its role in centralized management of Elastic Agents. This setup is crucial for efficient security monitoring across multiple endpoints.

## Understanding Fleet Server

1. Core Components
   - Fleet Server architecture
   - Communication protocols
   - Security features
   - Scalability options

2. Key Benefits
   - Centralized management
   - Automated updates
   - Policy enforcement
   - Real-time monitoring

## Installation and Setup

1. Prerequisites
   - System requirements
   - Network configuration
   - Security considerations
   - Access permissions

2. Fleet Server Deployment
   - Installation process
   - Configuration options
   - Security hardening
   - Integration with Elasticsearch

## Configuration Management

1. Policy Creation
   - Default policies
   - Custom policy development
   - Policy assignment
   - Version control

2. Agent Management
   - Enrollment tokens
   - Agent lifecycle
   - Health monitoring
   - Troubleshooting

## Security Considerations

1. Access Control
   - Authentication methods
   - Authorization levels
   - API security
   - Audit logging

2. Network Security
   - Communication encryption
   - Port configuration
   - Firewall rules
   - Certificate management

## Best Practices

1. Deployment Strategy
   - High availability setup
   - Load balancing
   - Backup procedures
   - Disaster recovery

2. Maintenance
   - Regular updates
   - Performance monitoring
   - Resource optimization
   - Capacity planning

## Next Steps

In Part 7, we'll dive into installing Elastic Agent and setting up Fleet Server, putting into practice the concepts we've covered here. We'll configure our first agents and establish our centralized management infrastructure.

Stay tuned as we continue building our security monitoring capabilities!
