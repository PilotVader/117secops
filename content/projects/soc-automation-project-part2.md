# SOC Automation Project - Part 2: Wazuh Deployment

Welcome to the second part of our SOC Automation series! In this part, we'll focus on deploying and configuring Wazuh as our SIEM solution. We'll build upon the infrastructure we set up in [Part 1](/projects/soc-automation-project-part1).

## What We'll Cover

1. Installing Wazuh Server
2. Configuring Wazuh Manager
3. Setting up Wazuh Agents
4. Implementing Basic Detection Rules
5. Configuring Alerts and Notifications

## Wazuh Architecture Overview

Before we begin the deployment, let's understand the key components of Wazuh:

- Wazuh Manager: Central component that analyzes data received from agents
- Wazuh Agents: Lightweight components installed on monitored systems
- Elastic Stack: For data visualization and search capabilities
- Wazuh API: RESTful API for integration with other tools
