## Introduction

In Part 9 of our SOC Analyst Challenge, we'll implement Sysmon on our Windows Server. This hands-on session will cover installation, configuration, and integration with our existing monitoring infrastructure.

## Installation Process

1. Prerequisites
   - Download Sysmon
   - Prepare configuration file
   - Administrative access
   - System requirements check

2. Installation Steps
   - Command-line installation
   - Service verification
   - Initial testing
   - Log verification

## Configuration Setup

1. Basic Configuration
   - Default settings
   - Event ID mapping
   - Logging options
   - Output formatting

2. Advanced Configuration
   - Custom rules creation
   - Filter optimization
   - Exclusion rules
   - Performance tuning

## Integration with Event Logging

1. Event Log Setup
