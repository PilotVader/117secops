## Day 9 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Installing and Configuring Sysmon on Windows Server

On Day 9 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I focused on setting up Sysmon on the Windows Server created on Day 5. Sysmon is a powerful tool from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite that enhances endpoint visibility by logging key activities such as process creation, network connections, and more. Here's how I did it.

## Downloading and Installing Sysmon

First, I connected to the Windows Server via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Once connected, I opened Microsoft Edge and searched for Sysmon on the Microsoft Learn site. I then downloaded the latest version of Sysmon (version 15.15 as of this writing) and extracted the contents to a directory on the server.

With the files extracted, I turned my attention to configuring Sysmon. I opted to use Olaf Hartong's popular Sysmon configuration file, which can be found on GitHub. This configuration file is widely used and highly customizable, allowing me to specify which events Sysmon should monitor.

## Configuring Sysmon

After downloading the configuration file (sysmonconfig.xml), I saved it in the Sysmon directory. I then opened PowerShell as an administrator and navigated to the directory where Sysmon was installed.

To install Sysmon with the configuration file, I used the following command in PowerShell:
```
sysmon64.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml
```

This command installs Sysmon and applies the configuration file. Once installed, Sysmon immediately begins logging events as per the configuration.

## Verifying Installation

To confirm that Sysmon was successfully installed, I checked both the Windows Services and Event Viewer. Sysmon appeared as a running service in the Services application. In Event Viewer, under Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon, I verified that Sysmon was actively generating logs, starting with Event ID 3, which logs network connections.

## Conclusion

With Sysmon now installed and logging critical events, the Windows Server is better equipped for monitoring and detecting malicious activities. In the next step of this challenge, I will learn how to push both Sysmon and Microsoft Defender logs to my Elasticsearch instance, enhancing my visibility and analysis capabilities.

## Day 10 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Ingesting Sysmon and Microsoft Defender Logs

On Day 10 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I focused on ingesting both Sysmon and Microsoft Defender event logs from the Windows Server into my Elasticsearch instance. This step is crucial for centralizing log data and enhancing my ability to detect and analyze potential security threats.

## Setting Up Custom Windows Event Log Integrations

I began by logging into the Elasticsearch instance and navigating to the Integrations page. I searched for and selected the "Custom Windows Event log" integration, which allows ingesting events from any Windows Event log channel.

For Sysmon, I created an integration named "my-dfir-win-sysmon" with the channel name "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational". For Windows Defender, I set up another integration named "my-dfir-win-defender" with the channel "Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational". In the Defender integration, I specified event IDs 1116, 1117, and 5001 to focus on malware detection and real-time protection status.

## Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues

Initially, no logs appeared in Elasticsearch. Upon investigating, I discovered that the Elastic agent on the Windows Server couldn't communicate with the Elasticsearch instance. The solution was to add a firewall rule allowing incoming connections to port 9200 on the Elasticsearch server. After implementing this change and restarting the Elastic agent service, logs began flowing into Elasticsearch.

## Verifying Log Ingestion

To confirm successful log ingestion, I used Elasticsearch's Discover page. I searched for Sysmon events with the query "winlog.event_id: 1" and for Windows Defender events with "winlog.event_id: 5001". Both queries returned results, confirming that the logs were being correctly ingested and indexed.

## Conclusion

With Sysmon and Microsoft Defender logs now being successfully ingested into Elasticsearch, I have significantly improved my ability to monitor and analyze security events on my Windows Server. This centralized log collection will be instrumental in detecting and investigating potential security incidents in the future.

In the next part of this challenge, I'll explore how to effectively query and analyze these logs within Elasticsearch, further enhancing my SOC analysis capabilities.

## Day 29 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Installing and Exploring Elastic Defend on Windows Server

## Overview

On Day 29, I focused on Elastic's Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool—Elastic Defend. This powerful EDR solution offers comprehensive endpoint protection and valuable telemetry to help monitor and respond to threats.

## Setting Up Elastic Defend

Elastic Defend is part of the Elastic Stack, and with the free 30-day trial, I could unlock additional features like full telemetry and host isolation. To get started, I accessed the Integrations section in Elastic, From there, I added Elastic Defend to my environment. Elastic Defend offers several configuration options, including:
- Data Collection
- Next-Gen Antivirus
- Essential EDR
- Complete EDR

For this challenge, I chose Complete EDR, I then deployed Elastic Defend to my Windows Server using a Fleet server, allowing centralized management of multiple endpoints.

## Monitoring and Testing

With Elastic Defend successfully installed, I checked the Security section in Kibana to ensure the endpoint appeared, confirming the agent was active. Elastic Defend offers multiple actions, including the ability to isolate the host, which is available with the trial version.

I wanted to test Elastic Defend's malware detection capabilities, so I ran the pilotvader.exe process on my Windows Server, simulating a malicious action. As expected, Elastic Defend instantly flagged and blocked the file. A message appeared stating that the operation couldn't be completed because the file contained a virus, and I received a malware prevention alert confirming the file had been quarantined.

## Investigating Telemetry

To dive deeper, I went into the Discover tab in Kibana and filtered the logs to view recent events. There, I found the malware prevention alert with detailed information about the malicious file, including:
- File hash
- Quarantine path
- Directory (C:\Users\Public\Downloads)

In the Security tab, I also explored the process tree, which showed the relationship between the legitimate explorer.exe process and the blocked pilotvader.exe. If the malware had spawned other processes, they would have also appeared here.

## Isolating the Host

Next, I tested Elastic Defend's host isolation feature. After initiating an infinite ping to Google's DNS (8.8.8.8), I re-downloaded the malicious file, which Elastic Defend promptly quarantined again. Soon after, the host was isolated, demonstrating Elastic Defend's ability to take responsive action against threats.

## Conclusion

Day 29 was a valuable deep dive into Elastic Defend. I learned how to install, monitor, and test its EDR capabilities, reinforcing its importance for endpoint security. I'll wrap up the challenge tomorrow by reviewing troubleshooting techniques and fine-tuning detection strategies.

## Day 24 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Setting Up and Configuring OS Ticket

## Overview

On Day 24 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge! I'll dive into OS Ticket, a ticketing system that will be an essential tool for my SOC operations. The aim is to set up OS Ticket successfully and configure it on a Windows Server. This system will streamline ticket management for the alerts we'll deal with throughout the challenge. Let's get started!

## Deploying the Server

The first step in setting up OS Ticket is to deploy a server. I used Vulture for this process, selecting "Cloud Compute" with a shared CPU and Windows Server 2022. The server specifications don't need to be too powerful; I chose 1 CPU and 2 GB of memory. After selecting a location and setting up firewall configurations, the server was ready for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access.

## Setting Up the Web Server

Once connected to the server, I installed XAMPP, a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution. XAMPP makes it easy to set up Apache, MySQL, and PHP, all necessary for OS Ticket to function. After downloading XAMPP, I configured it by:

- Changing the Apache domain name to my server's public IP address
- Modifying the phpMyAdmin configuration to ensure secure access from my SOC analyst laptop

## Configuring Firewall Rules

Before moving further, I created inbound firewall rules for ports 80 and 443. This ensures that only authorized devices can access the web server. With XAMPP running, I started both the Apache and MySQL services and verified that everything was configured correctly.

## Installing OS Ticket

Next, I downloaded OS Ticket from their official site, choosing the latest stable version. After extracting the files, I moved them to the XAMPP htdocs folder to be served by the Apache server. Once the web server was up and running, I accessed the OS Ticket setup page, which prompted me to configure the system. This included:

- Renaming configuration files
- Setting up a MySQL database for OS Ticket to store data

## Finalizing the Installation

With the database created and the necessary configurations in place, the final step was to run the OS Ticket installation. After entering admin details and configuring the database connection, the OS Ticket was successfully installed. I also ensured file permissions were properly set for security.

## Conclusion

With this system, I'll be able to manage SOC alerts efficiently. Up next, I'll explore how to integrate OS Ticket with my tech stack so that alerts automatically generate tickets.
