## Day 18 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Understanding Command and Control (C2)

## Overview

Welcome to Day 18 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge. Today, our focus would be on an essential part of cyberattacks, Command and Control (C2). In this blog, we'll go over what C2 is, why it's crucial for attackers, and the common tools they use. We'll also look at one particular framework, Mythic, which we will use later in this challenge.

## What is Command and Control?

Command and Control (C2) refers to the techniques attackers use to communicate with systems they have compromised in a victim's network. According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, C2 allows attackers to maintain control over the compromised system, enabling them to perform various malicious activities.

Once attackers gain access to a victim's machine, they need a way to interact with it remotely. C2 helps them move closer to their end goal, stealing credentials, exfiltrating data, or deploying ransomware.

## Why is Establishing C2 Important?

The importance of C2 for attackers cannot be overstated. Without it, they couldn't perform further actions on the compromised network. C2 is a gateway for attackers to escalate privileges, move laterally, steal sensitive information, or even disrupt services.

For attackers to cause harm, they must maintain access to the network, which they do through C2 channels. The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists 18 different techniques attackers use to establish C2, and understanding these techniques is crucial for any SOC analyst.

## Common Tools and Frameworks for C2

Several C2 frameworks are used in the wild. Let's focus on four of the most common:

### 1. Metasploit
Metasploit is a popular framework used for vulnerability exploitation. It's widely available and often used in ethical hacking environments, but attackers also use it to exploit vulnerable systems.

### 2. Cobalt Strike
Cobalt Strike is a commercial adversary emulation tool. Though it's legitimate software, attackers frequently use it in real-world breaches. Fortunately, because it's so widely used, there are many detection methods available.

### 3. Sliver
Sliver is an open-source alternative to Cobalt Strike, developed by Bishop Fox. It supports multiple protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS, making it a versatile tool for attackers.

### 4. Mythic
Mythic is the framework I'll be using in this challenge. Built with GoLang and Docker, Mythic provides a user-friendly interface for managing payloads and C2 profiles. This flexibility makes it a favorite for adversary emulation.

## Conclusion

In the next part of the challenge, I'll dive deeper into crafting attacks on our Windows Server and setting up a Mythic C2 server. Stay tuned as we explore how to deploy agents and establish a successful C2 session.

## Day 28 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Investigating the Mythic C2 Framework

## Overview

On Day 28 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I shifted my focus to the Mythic Command and Control (C2) framework. Attackers widely use this framework to maintain control over compromised systems, allowing them to execute commands, steal data, and conduct other malicious activities without detection. My task was to investigate how the Mythic agent svchost_pilotvader.exe operated and how its communication could be detected.

## Tracing the Mythic C2 Agent

My investigation's first step was locating the Mythic C2 agent on one of the compromised systems. Armed with the knowledge of the agent's name, I used the Kibana Discover tool to search through the logs, narrowing the time range to the past 30 days. This allowed me to pinpoint 25 distinct events associated with the agent. Sorting these events chronologically, I was able to reconstruct the timeline of the agent's activity, gaining critical insight into how it interacted with the system over time.

## Identifying C2 Traffic Through Network Telemetry

In cases where the agent's name isn't known, identifying suspicious traffic can be challenging. Network telemetry analysis plays a critical role in detecting C2 activity. I began by analyzing network logs to identify the "top talkers"âthe machines that generated the most traffic. Since Mythic, like most C2 frameworks, relies on consistent communication between the infected host and the attacker's server, unusual traffic patterns often stand out.

To refine my detection, I utilized RITA (Real Intelligence Threat Analytics), a tool designed to detect beaconing behavior in C2 traffic. Beaconing occurs when an infected machine regularly checks in with a C2 server, and identifying these intervals allowed me to isolate Mythic's communication patterns. The detection of this regular network activity provided strong evidence of the C2 framework's presence.

## Investigating Process Creation Logs

Beyond network traffic, process creation analysis was essential for tracing the agent's activity. By examining these logs, I could see the exact processes initiated by the Mythic agent and track the attacker's movement within the system. These logs offer a detailed view of how the agent behaves, from its initial execution to spawning other processes critical to maintaining control over the system.

## Conclusion

Day 28's deep dive into the Mythic C2 framework offered valuable lessons in tracking adversary behavior. By leveraging network telemetry, beaconing detection, and process creation logs, I was able to uncover the activities of the Mythic agent and better understand its communication patterns. As the challenge nears its end, these investigations continue to hone my skills in threat detection and incident response.

## Day 20 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Setting Up Mythic C2

## Overview

On Day 20 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I set up Mythic C2, a command-and-control (C2) framework. This day's challenge was focused on getting familiar with the Mythic interface, installing it on a cloud server, and tightening its security configurations.

## Deploying Mythic on Vulture Cloud

The first step was logging into the Vulture cloud provider and deploying a new server. I opted for Cloud Compute with a shared CPU, choosing Ubuntu with 4GB of RAM. After naming the server and starting the deployment, I prepared to install Kali Linux on my machine.

## Installing Kali Linux

I headed to the official Kali site and downloaded the VMware version for the Kali Linux setup, as I would run it on a virtual machine. After extracting the download, I loaded the .vmx file into VMware Workstation, started Kali, and ensured it ran smoothly.

## SSH Into Mythic Server

With the Mythic server ready on Vulture, I accessed it using SSH through PowerShell. After logging in, I updated the system repositories with apt-get update and apt-get upgrade. I then installed Docker, Docker Compose, and the make tool to ensure Mythic would run correctly.

## Installing Mythic

Next, I cloned the Mythic repository from GitHub and navigated into the directory. The installation process was initiated using a shell script designed for Docker on Ubuntu. Once the installation was completed, I encountered a minor issue with Docker not starting but resolved it by restarting the service.

## Configuring Mythic

With Mythic running, I began configuring the system. To enhance security, I created a custom firewall rule that only allowed my machine and specific agents to communicate with the Mythic server. This step ensured that no unauthorized IPs could attempt to access the server.

## Accessing Mythic's Web GUI

Finally, I logged into Mythic's web GUI using the server's IP and port 7443. I retrieved the login credentials from the environment variables stored on the server and successfully accessed the dashboard, where I explored the various options for managing payloads, callbacks, and more.

## Conclusion

With Mythic C2 set up and configured, I'm now ready to start generating payloads and testing them against our Windows server in future challenges. This setup is crucial for understanding C2 frameworks and is a key step for any SOC analyst. Stay tuned as I dive deeper into Mythic's capabilities in the upcoming challenges!

#CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #MYDFIRChallenge #HandsOnExperience #Day20 16:Tb3a,
## Day 22 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Creating Alerts and Dashboards for Mythic C2 Detection

## Overview

On Day 22 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I focused on creating alerts and dashboards to detect Mythic C2 activity, building on the groundwork from Day 21. This step is crucial in setting up efficient monitoring and detection of suspicious activity within the SOC environment.

## Creating the Alert

I started by accessing the Elastic web UI, navigating to the Discover section, and resetting the view. To ensure I captured relevant events, I set the time range to 30 days. This gave me a clear view of the events linked to "svchost-pilotvader.exe," which was triggered by our Mythic C2 agent in the previous exercise.

The next step was filtering the process creation events using Sysmon's event code 1. This allowed me to see details like the MD5 hash of the binary associated with Mythic C2. Using this information, I further investigated the event by cross-referencing the SHA-1 hash with VirusTotal for additional context. Since the agent was newly created, the results were limited but still useful.

Interestingly, the original file name of the Mythic C2 agent was "apollo.exe," even though it was executed as "svchost-pilotvader.exe." This discrepancy helped pinpoint the activity more accurately, making it a prime candidate for alert creation.

## Setting the Alert

I created a query based on event code 1 for process creation. The query focused on the SHA-256 hash and the original file name "apollo.exe." Once the alert was set, it was designed to trigger whenever Mythic C2 activity surfaced in the environment.

## Building the Dashboard

Next, I built a dashboard to visualize the Mythic C2 activity. By leveraging Elastic's Kibana features, I set up visualizations that track key metrics, such as:

- Process creation events
- File hashes
- Network connections linked to Mythic C2

The dashboard provides real-time insights, allowing for faster detection and response to similar threats in the future.

## Conclusion

With the alert and dashboard in place, I've taken an important step toward proactive monitoring of Mythic C2 activity. These tools will enhance the detection and visibility of malicious actions within the environment. Next, I'll refine my detection capabilities by expanding these alerts and dashboards to cover more complex threats.
