## Levelling Up: From VirtualBox to a Full Hardware Cybersecurity Home Lab (Project V117)

If there's one thing that's been both my playground as a cybersecurity enthusiast, it's my home lab. I didn't just throw hardware together, I engineered a mini datacenter that lets me break things, fix them, and build skills that go beyond the classroom or certification paths.

So let me walk you through how I set it all up, from network design, hardware choices, and wiring, to the virtual machines running inside.

## The Blueprint

Before buying a single cable, I sat down and mapped out what I needed:
- A solid core network
- A powerful, reliable server
- A firewall/router to control traffic
- A proper switch to interconnect everything
- And most importantly: internet access without having to buy a new broadband plan

## The Physical Stack

Here's the physical breakdown of what I used:

### The Switch
At the heart of my lab sits a Cisco SG500X-24, a 24-port managed switch with RJ45 1GbE ports. This switch gives me full control over VLANs, trunking, port security, and QoS, which is perfect for mimicking enterprise-level setups. I got this because later in future I plan to manually configure VLANs for different zones (e.g., management, attack, internal, DMZ), so I could isolate traffic and simulate real-world networks.

### The Server
Then comes my main server, which I affectionately call the Node-V117.
- CPU: Intel Xeon E5-2689 (8 cores, 16 threads)
- RAM: 64 GB ECC (Error Correcting Code)
- Storage: 3 SSDs for fast I/O
- GPU: NVIDIA Quadro card, mostly used for potential GPU passthrough and future ML experiments

This beast runs Proxmox VE, a Type-1 hypervisor that gives me the power to run several virtual machines and containers. If you're serious about virtualisation, Proxmox is the real deal.

### The OPNsense Firewall
For routing and security experimentation, I installed OPNsense on an HP T730 Thin Client. It's a sleek, fanless device that runs silently and comes equipped with a dual 2.5GbE NIC, perfect for future networking experiments. I configured the interfaces for WAN (connected to my laptop for internet) and LAN (connected to the switch), giving me complete control over firewall rules, NAT, and traffic shaping. Right now, it's sitting in place and connected, ready to be the core of my network security setup when I begin more advanced testing.

## The Wiring and Internet Hack

One of the most interesting parts of my setup was getting the entire homelab online, without a dedicated internet line. For now, I bridged my laptop's internet connection to the firewall as a temporary workaround. It works for basic connectivity and testing, but I'm already seeing its limitations in bandwidth, stability, and accessibility. Eventually, I plan to set up a dedicated internet line for the lab to unlock more advanced use cases, such as remote access, persistent services, and uninterrupted updates.

Here's how I did it:

1. Laptop Internet Sharing
   - My laptop connects to Wi-Fi
   - I shared this connection through the Ethernet port using Windows' Internet Sharing feature

2. Cable Run
   - I plugged an Ethernet cable from the laptop into the WAN port of the HP T730 running OPNsense

3. Firewall Setup
   - In OPNsense, I configured the WAN interface to get an IP via DHCP (coming from the laptop)
   - Then set the LAN IP range (e.g., 192.168.100.1/24) and turned on DHCP for internal devices

4. Switch Cabling
   - The LAN port of the firewall connects to port 1 on the Cisco switch
   - My server's NIC connects to port 2
   - The remaining ports were available for VMs or any other device I want to simulate

## Virtual Machines

On Proxmox, I spun up multiple VMs, each serving a different purpose:
- Windows 10 & 11: For endpoint security testing, malware analysis, and AD simulations
- Ubuntu Server: Hosting lightweight services, honeypots, and ELK stack
- Kali Linux: My offensive workstation, preloaded with tools like Burp Suite, Metasploit, and Nmap

Later, as I expand my knowledge, I would place each VM on its own VLAN or subnet, and intentionally misconfigure some for security testing, because what's a lab without vulnerabilities?

## Use Cases and Next Steps

With this lab, I can:
- Simulate red vs. blue team scenarios
- Build and monitor logs from Windows endpoints
- Train with SIEM tools like Wazuh
- Set up phishing simulations and response workflows
- Test firewall rules, intrusion detection, and segmentation

The plan is to keep building on this, maybe add Active Directory, integrate SOAR tools like Shuffle(which I'm already working on currently), and even try deploying a Kubernetes cluster on Ubuntu.

## Conclusion

Setting up this lab wasn't just about putting hardware together, it was about creating an environment where I could think like an attacker, build like an engineer, and defend like a blue teamer. Every time I boot up a VM, I'm building muscle memory for real-world problem solving.

If you're thinking of building your own lab, start small but think big. And don't wait for the perfect setup. I started out running labs in VirtualBox, just trying to get a feel for the tools and workflows. But eventually, I knew I needed to experience real hardware and full network environments. So I made this work, with shared internet and repurposed gear. It's not about perfection; it's about progress.

## Installing a 4TB SATA Hard Drive in My Proxmox Server

### Overview

To expand my Proxmox VE bare-metal server's storage, I installed a 4TB SATA 3.5" hard drive. Although the hardware was correctly connected, the drive initially failed to appear in Proxmox or in the system's disk utilities. This write-up documents how I diagnosed and resolved the issue.

### Initial Symptoms

After physically installing the drive with both SATA power and data cables connected to the motherboard, the system did not detect the disk. Tools like `lsblk`, `fdisk -l`, and the Proxmox GUI showed no sign of it.

Despite this, the drive was powered—audibly spinning—and `dmesg` logs showed that SATA link negotiation occurred at 6.0 Gbps. However, there was no device registered as `/dev/sdX`, suggesting a failure in initialization.

### Diagnostic Process

I confirmed the SATA cable and power lines were functional by testing them with other working drives. Swapping ports on the motherboard yielded no change. BIOS settings were inspected to confirm that AHCI mode was enabled and that all SATA ports were active.

I then tested the drive using a USB-to-SATA adapter. While a smaller 2.5" drive was successfully detected through the adapter, the 3.5" drive failed to power up correctly—implying insufficient power delivery via USB.

### Resolution

A full system reboot with the drive plugged into a known-good SATA port allowed proper detection. Upon restart, the disk appeared in `fdisk -l` and `lsblk` as `/dev/sdX`.

With the device now detected, I wiped previous signatures using `wipefs -a`, then formatted it using `mkfs.ext4`. I mounted the drive under `/mnt/4tbdrive` and added the appropriate entry to `/etc/fstab` for persistence.

### Conclusion

This issue highlighted how a drive may appear to function at the hardware level while still failing OS-level detection due to incomplete initialisation. A simple reboot can often trigger proper enumeration. It's a reminder to combine physical verification with system-level diagnostics and to never overlook the importance of full reboots in hardware troubleshooting.

## Segmenting My Cybersecurity Homelab Using VLANs

After completing the initial build of my cybersecurity homelab, I knew the next big milestone was network segmentation. I wanted to separate my environment into distinct VLANs for better traffic control, improved security, and a more organized deployment of my tools and virtual machines. The concept was simple in theory, separate traffic logically while maintaining complete control from a single pane.

My initial spark for this came from Gerard O'Brien, whose breakdown of homelab network segmentation introduced me to the idea of creating isolated VLANs for each category of devices or services. It made perfect sense: isolate your security tools, isolate vulnerable machines, isolate test environments, all while routing through a central firewall. Along the way, I hit several roadblocks. That's where Koroma Tech came in. His YouTube series covered VLAN segmentation using OPNsense, Cisco switches, and Proxmox, the exact gear I had. His breakdown helped untangle many of the issues I ran into and became an invaluable guide during troubleshooting.

## Initial Vision

I began with a vision of building an enterprise-style segmented lab. The goal was to use OPNsense as my central router and firewall, Proxmox to host all VMs, and a Cisco switch to trunk the VLANs across the environment. I planned four main VLANs:

A VLAN for security tools, which would house platforms like Wazuh and TheHive. A separate VLAN for vulnerable machines, which I could target with Kali Linux and test detection pipelines. Another VLAN would be reserved for a Windows environment, where I could simulate real endpoints and domain controllers. Finally, I wanted a VLAN for Docker containers, to explore containerized security tools and microservices.

All of this was connected by a Cisco SG500X-24 switch, a Proxmox server with multiple bonded NICs, and an OPNsense firewall running on a dedicated thin client. Internet was shared into the lab via Ethernet from a laptop using a Wi-Fi uplink, serving as a temporary ISP connection.

## Configuring the Cisco Switch

The first step was to configure VLANs on the Cisco switch. Inside the VLAN Management interface, I created VLANs 1 (default), 5, 10, 20, and 30. I used port GE1 as the trunk port connected to the Proxmox server and port GE2 as the uplink to the OPNsense firewall.

Trunking configuration was critical. GE1 needed to be tagged for VLANs 5, 10, 20, and 30. This would allow Proxmox to forward VLAN-tagged traffic into the switch and out toward the firewall. Cisco switches, however, require each port to have one untagged VLAN. I initially attempted to remove all untagged VLANs but was met with an error. It turns out VLAN 1 must remain as the untagged VLAN by default. I left it in place and tagged the rest.

Ports assigned to VM-specific devices were configured as access ports, tagged only for their respective VLANs. For example, GE5 might be an access port for VLAN 20 (Windows), and GE6 for VLAN 10 (Kali Linux).

## VLAN Interface Setup in OPNsense

On the OPNsense firewall, the VLAN interfaces were built on top of the physical NIC (RE2) connected to the Cisco switch. For each VLAN, I created a corresponding virtual interface, such as RE2_vlan20 for VLAN 20, and then assigned it inside the OPNsense GUI.

Each VLAN interface was given a static IP address, for example, 10.10.20.1/24 for VLAN 20, and a DHCP server was configured to assign IPs within that range. I added basic allow-all rules in the firewall for each VLAN subnet to ensure traffic could flow during testing. One misstep I encountered was related to firewall rules: DHCP leases weren't being issued at first, and I later discovered that a deny rule was taking precedence above my allow rule. Once I reordered them, DHCP worked flawlessly.

## Bridging and Bonding in Proxmox

This was one of the trickiest parts of the build. My Proxmox server had three network interfaces, enp10s0, enp9s0, and enp6s0, which were originally bonded into a single interface, bond0. This bond0 wasn't attached to vmbr0, my default Linux bridge, which wasn't VLAN-aware.

Inspired by Koroma Tech's video, I thought I needed to separate one NIC and create a new Linux bridge, vmbr1, for the VLANs. I detached enp6s0 from the bond and attached it to vmbr1. This led to chaos: Proxmox VMs could no longer reach the internet, static IPs weren't being assigned, DHCP requests failed, and the web interface became intermittently unreachable. I had to access the server via shell and manually fix /etc/network/interfaces. A simple ifreload -a command even took the network down temporarily.

The realization hit after consulting Koroma Tech and rewatching his video (Thanks for his response): I never needed a second bridge. The original vmbr0, was to be made to point to bond0, and that would have been perfectly capable of handling VLAN-tagged traffic, provided the VLAN-aware checkbox was enabled, which I eventually did. So I reverted everything. I re-added enp6s0 to the bond, reset the bridge to vmbr0, and things began to work.

## Assigning VLANs to VMs in Proxmox

With vmbr0 correctly configured, the next step was assigning VLAN tags to the VMs. In each VM configuration, I went to Hardware → Network Device, edited the NIC, and added the VLAN tag that matched the desired segment. For instance, the Windows VM was given VLAN 20, Kali got VLAN 10, and my Docker VM received VLAN 30.

Once this was done, I rebooted the VMs and ran ipconfig or ifconfig to verify the network settings. To my satisfaction, each VM pulled the correct IP address from its respective VLAN subnet, configured on OPNsense and trunked through the Cisco switch.

## The Debugging Journey

I ran into every possible issue: Proxmox network down, static IP not picked, DHCP not working, OPNsense not receiving traffic, and even Cisco switch ports refusing certain configs. I spent hours running packet captures on OPNsense to see if DHCP DISCOVER packets were even hitting the firewall, in many cases, they weren't, due to tagging or misassigned switch ports.

It wasn't until I fully understood how each layer, Proxmox, the switch, and OPNsense, handled tagged traffic that things started to align. The concept of trunk ports, access ports, tagging at the VM level, VLAN-aware bridges, and proper interface assignment all had to be in perfect harmony.

## Conclusion

This project pushed me. I'm proud of how it turned out, not just because everything is now working, but because I truly understand the system I built. VLANs are no longer just theory to me. I've lived the chaos, the packet loss, the empty DHCP leases, and the recovery.

Massive thanks to Gerard O'Brien for the foundational inspiration and to Koroma Tech for the actionable guidance and video breakdowns that helped me debug when things went south. He even took time to respond to my messages, and that helped keep me grounded.

If you're reading this and planning to segment your own lab: take it slow, understand each component, and know that breaking things is part of the journey. My next steps will be building services like Wazuh, TheHive, and Arkime inside their respective VLANs, and expanding the lab even further, now with a proper backbone in place.

# Part 2: Generating Telemetry and Analyzing Attacks

My focus has shifted to generating telemetry data for analysis, a critical step in detecting malicious activities.

## Scanning with Nmap

I started the telemetry generation process with Nmap. This enabled me to conduct a comprehensive scan of my Windows VM, identifying open ports and services that could be potential attack vectors. This reconnaissance phase helped me understand the attack surface and assess vulnerabilities within my environment.

The scan revealed several open ports, notably Port 3389, associated with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Identifying such services is crucial as they can serve as entry points for attackers seeking to exploit system weaknesses.

## Crafting Malware with Metasploit

After reconnaissance, I shifted to creating a simulated attack using Metasploit, a widely used framework for penetration testing. I crafted a reverse shell payload, a common technique used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to target systems. This exercise provided insight into the attack lifecycle and how malicious actors exploit systems.

With the malicious executable ready, I set up a listener in Metasploit to capture any incoming connections from the reverse shell. This involved configuring the Metasploit environment for potential exploitation attempts from the crafted payload.

## Executing the Malware

Once the payload and listener were in place, I set up an HTTP server using Python on my attacking OS. I accessed the server from my Windows machine to download the malware. To simulate a real-world scenario, I disabled Windows Defender to allow the payload to execute unhindered.

After running the payload, I monitored my parrot machine for an incoming connection, indicating a successful exploit. I executed basic commands like SHELL, NET USER, and IP CONFIG to generate telemetry data.

## Analyzing Telemetry with Splunk

With the simulated attack executed, I turned to analyzing the telemetry generated by the activities in my lab. I configured Splunk to ingest system logs from Sysmon, setting up an index dedicated to endpoint monitoring.

By correlating telemetry data with events from the attack simulation, I gained insights into the attack lifecycle. I reviewed logs for indicators of compromise, including the creation and execution of the reverse shell. This analysis is essential for developing effective detection strategies in a real-world Security Operations Center (SOC).

## Conclusion

Through these exercises, I've deepened my understanding of the attack lifecycle and the importance of telemetry in incident response. Generating and analyzing telemetry data is fundamental for any aspiring SOC analyst. In the coming days, I plan to refine my detection capabilities further and explore additional avenues for generating and analyzing telemetry.
