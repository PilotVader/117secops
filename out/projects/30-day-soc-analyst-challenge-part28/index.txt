## Day 28 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Investigating the Mythic C2 Framework

## Overview

On Day 28 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I shifted my focus to the Mythic Command and Control (C2) framework. Attackers widely use this framework to maintain control over compromised systems, allowing them to execute commands, steal data, and conduct other malicious activities without detection. My task was to investigate how the Mythic agent svchost_pilotvader.exe operated and how its communication could be detected.

## Tracing the Mythic C2 Agent

My investigation's first step was locating the Mythic C2 agent on one of the compromised systems. Armed with the knowledge of the agent's name, I used the Kibana Discover tool to search through the logs, narrowing the time range to the past 30 days. This allowed me to pinpoint 25 distinct events associated with the agent. Sorting these events chronologically, I was able to reconstruct the timeline of the agent's activity, gaining critical insight into how it interacted with the system over time.

## Identifying C2 Traffic Through Network Telemetry

In cases where the agent's name isn't known, identifying suspicious traffic can be challenging. Network telemetry analysis plays a critical role in detecting C2 activity. I began by analyzing network logs to identify the "top talkers"—the machines that generated the most traffic. Since Mythic, like most C2 frameworks, relies on consistent communication between the infected host and the attacker's server, unusual traffic patterns often stand out.

To refine my detection, I utilized RITA (Real Intelligence Threat Analytics), a tool designed to detect beaconing behavior in C2 traffic. Beaconing occurs when an infected machine regularly checks in with a C2 server, and identifying these intervals allowed me to isolate Mythic's communication patterns. The detection of this regular network activity provided strong evidence of the C2 framework's presence.

## Investigating Process Creation Logs

Beyond network traffic, process creation analysis was essential for tracing the agent's activity. By examining these logs, I could see the exact processes initiated by the Mythic agent and track the attacker's movement within the system. These logs offer a detailed view of how the agent behaves, from its initial execution to spawning other processes critical to maintaining control over the system.

## Conclusion

Day 28's deep dive into the Mythic C2 framework offered valuable lessons in tracking adversary behavior. By leveraging network telemetry, beaconing detection, and process creation logs, I was able to uncover the activities of the Mythic agent and better understand its communication patterns. As the challenge nears its end, these investigations continue to hone my skills in threat detection and incident response.

## Day 20 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Setting Up Mythic C2

## Overview

On Day 20 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I set up Mythic C2, a command-and-control (C2) framework. This day's challenge was focused on getting familiar with the Mythic interface, installing it on a cloud server, and tightening its security configurations.

## Deploying Mythic on Vulture Cloud

The first step was logging into the Vulture cloud provider and deploying a new server. I opted for Cloud Compute with a shared CPU, choosing Ubuntu with 4GB of RAM. After naming the server and starting the deployment, I prepared to install Kali Linux on my machine.

## Installing Kali Linux

I headed to the official Kali site and downloaded the VMware version for the Kali Linux setup, as I would run it on a virtual machine. After extracting the download, I loaded the .vmx file into VMware Workstation, started Kali, and ensured it ran smoothly.

## SSH Into Mythic Server

With the Mythic server ready on Vulture, I accessed it using SSH through PowerShell. After logging in, I updated the system repositories with apt-get update and apt-get upgrade. I then installed Docker, Docker Compose, and the make tool to ensure Mythic would run correctly.

## Installing Mythic

Next, I cloned the Mythic repository from GitHub and navigated into the directory. The installation process was initiated using a shell script designed for Docker on Ubuntu. Once the installation was completed, I encountered a minor issue with Docker not starting but resolved it by restarting the service.

## Configuring Mythic

With Mythic running, I began configuring the system. To enhance security, I created a custom firewall rule that only allowed my machine and specific agents to communicate with the Mythic server. This step ensured that no unauthorized IPs could attempt to access the server.

## Accessing Mythic's Web GUI

Finally, I logged into Mythic's web GUI using the server's IP and port 7443. I retrieved the login credentials from the environment variables stored on the server and successfully accessed the dashboard, where I explored the various options for managing payloads, callbacks, and more.

## Conclusion

With Mythic C2 set up and configured, I'm now ready to start generating payloads and testing them against our Windows server in future challenges. This setup is crucial for understanding C2 frameworks and is a key step for any SOC analyst. Stay tuned as I dive deeper into Mythic's capabilities in the upcoming challenges!

#CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #MYDFIRChallenge #HandsOnExperience #Day20 15:Tce4,
## Day 18 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Understanding Command and Control (C2)

## Overview

Welcome to Day 18 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge. Today, our focus would be on an essential part of cyberattacks, Command and Control (C2). In this blog, we'll go over what C2 is, why it's crucial for attackers, and the common tools they use. We'll also look at one particular framework, Mythic, which we will use later in this challenge.

## What is Command and Control?

Command and Control (C2) refers to the techniques attackers use to communicate with systems they have compromised in a victim's network. According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, C2 allows attackers to maintain control over the compromised system, enabling them to perform various malicious activities.

Once attackers gain access to a victim's machine, they need a way to interact with it remotely. C2 helps them move closer to their end goal, stealing credentials, exfiltrating data, or deploying ransomware.

## Why is Establishing C2 Important?

The importance of C2 for attackers cannot be overstated. Without it, they couldn't perform further actions on the compromised network. C2 is a gateway for attackers to escalate privileges, move laterally, steal sensitive information, or even disrupt services.

For attackers to cause harm, they must maintain access to the network, which they do through C2 channels. The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists 18 different techniques attackers use to establish C2, and understanding these techniques is crucial for any SOC analyst.

## Common Tools and Frameworks for C2

Several C2 frameworks are used in the wild. Let's focus on four of the most common:

### 1. Metasploit
Metasploit is a popular framework used for vulnerability exploitation. It's widely available and often used in ethical hacking environments, but attackers also use it to exploit vulnerable systems.

### 2. Cobalt Strike
Cobalt Strike is a commercial adversary emulation tool. Though it's legitimate software, attackers frequently use it in real-world breaches. Fortunately, because it's so widely used, there are many detection methods available.

### 3. Sliver
Sliver is an open-source alternative to Cobalt Strike, developed by Bishop Fox. It supports multiple protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS, making it a versatile tool for attackers.

### 4. Mythic
Mythic is the framework I'll be using in this challenge. Built with GoLang and Docker, Mythic provides a user-friendly interface for managing payloads and C2 profiles. This flexibility makes it a favorite for adversary emulation.

## Conclusion

In the next part of the challenge, I'll dive deeper into crafting attacks on our Windows Server and setting up a Mythic C2 server. Stay tuned as we explore how to deploy agents and establish a successful C2 session.

## Day 27 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Investigating an RDP Brute Force Attack

## Overview

On Day 27 of my 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I shifted focus to investigating an RDP brute force attack alert. The process follows a similar methodology to investigating an SSH brute force attack, with the only major difference being the protocol in question. Here's how I broke it down.

## Reviewing the Alert

I started by navigating to the alerts section in my web interface, filtering for RDP brute force alerts. Out of 327 total alerts, I found 5 related to RDP brute force. I selected one of the alerts and also took note of the source IP, which had a username attempt of "administrator." There were 5 events in total, so I dug deeper into the details.

## Automating Ticket Creation in OS Ticket

Because I had already set up an automated ticket creation system for SSH brute force alerts, I decided to replicate the process for this RDP alert. Using the existing SSH rule, I copied the webhook details and applied them to the RDP brute force rule. This allowed me to automatically generate a ticket within OS Ticket whenever an RDP brute force attack is detected.

## Investigating the IP Address

For the next steps, I wanted to gather more information about the attacking IP address. First, I used AbuseIPDB, which revealed that the IP had been reported 71 times, with a 63% confidence score of malicious activity, mostly relating to RDP brute force attempts. Then, I checked GreyNoise, which classified the IP as "unknown intent," meaning it was engaged in internet-wide scanning but not specifically targeting my environment. This data gave me enough confidence to mark the IP as associated with RDP brute force activity.

## Analyzing for Affected Users

I next wanted to see if any other users were targeted by the attacker. After filtering my logs for the past 30 days, I found 271 events related to this IP, but all of them were focused on the "administrator" account. This confirmed that no other user accounts had been affected.

## Checking for Successful Logins

A crucial part of any brute force investigation is determining whether the attacker was successful. In this case, I looked for Windows event code 4624, which indicates a successful login. Fortunately, there were no successful authentication attempts from this IP address, so I could confirm that the attack had failed.

## Conclusion

Even though there were no successful logins in this case, the investigation served as a good reminder of the importance of thorough log review and automated alerting. In the next step of this challenge, I'll be diving deeper into another investigation, this time analyzing activity from the Mythic C2 agent. Stay tuned for more insights!
