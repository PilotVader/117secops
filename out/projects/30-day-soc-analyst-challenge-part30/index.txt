## Day 30 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Conclusion

## Overview

As I complete the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, the journey has significantly deepened my understanding of SOC operations and cybersecurity best practices. Over these 30 days, I've worked with key tools, investigated real-world threats, and honed my incident response skills. Here's a recap of the most valuable lessons from this experience.

## Setting Up the Foundation: Elasticsearch, Kibana, and OS Ticket

The challenge began with setting up the core tools for a functional SOC environment: Elasticsearch and Kibana. These tools allowed me to collect, visualize, and analyze security data. I learned how to create dashboards that provided real-time insights into:
- Brute-force attacks
- Login attempts
- Suspicious RDP activity

Integrating OS Ticket into my environment was a significant milestone, as it automated incident management, ensuring every alert was systematically tracked and addressed.

## Advanced Detection and Response

As the challenge progressed, I encountered various real-world attack simulations. Investigating brute-force attacks—both SSH and RDP—taught me the importance of:
- Log analysis
- IP reputation checking
- Using tools like AbuseIPDB and GreyNoise

I gained hands-on experience in identifying and responding to malicious activity. Automating ticket creation for brute-force alerts streamlined the incident-handling process, reinforcing how crucial automation is in a fast-paced SOC environment.

## Command and Control (C2) Detection

A key highlight of the challenge was investigating the Mythic C2 framework, which provided insight into how attackers use Command and Control (C2) agents to maintain access to compromised systems. I utilized:
- Network telemetry
- Tools like RITA to identify beaconing behavior
- Process creation logs

This experience demonstrated the importance of understanding network traffic and process creation logs in detecting persistent threats.

## Endpoint Security with Elastic Defend

One of the most critical components of the challenge was deploying Elastic Defend for endpoint detection and response (EDR). By testing:
- Malware detection
- Host isolation
- Telemetry data analysis

I experienced firsthand how EDR solutions play a vital role in securing endpoints. I explored Elastic's telemetry data to investigate threats more deeply and learned how to prevent and mitigate attacks by quarantining malicious files and isolating compromised hosts.

## Looking Ahead

A big thank you to [@MyDFIR](https://www.youtube.com/@MyDFIR) for creating this challenge. It provided invaluable hands-on experience, deepened my technical skills, and gave me valuable insights into the day-to-day work of a SOC analyst. The challenge has equipped me with practical skills in:

## Day 29 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Installing and Exploring Elastic Defend on Windows Server

## Overview

On Day 29, I focused on Elastic's Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool—Elastic Defend. This powerful EDR solution offers comprehensive endpoint protection and valuable telemetry to help monitor and respond to threats.

## Setting Up Elastic Defend

Elastic Defend is part of the Elastic Stack, and with the free 30-day trial, I could unlock additional features like full telemetry and host isolation. To get started, I accessed the Integrations section in Elastic, From there, I added Elastic Defend to my environment. Elastic Defend offers several configuration options, including:
- Data Collection
- Next-Gen Antivirus
- Essential EDR
- Complete EDR

For this challenge, I chose Complete EDR, I then deployed Elastic Defend to my Windows Server using a Fleet server, allowing centralized management of multiple endpoints.

## Monitoring and Testing

With Elastic Defend successfully installed, I checked the Security section in Kibana to ensure the endpoint appeared, confirming the agent was active. Elastic Defend offers multiple actions, including the ability to isolate the host, which is available with the trial version.

I wanted to test Elastic Defend's malware detection capabilities, so I ran the pilotvader.exe process on my Windows Server, simulating a malicious action. As expected, Elastic Defend instantly flagged and blocked the file. A message appeared stating that the operation couldn't be completed because the file contained a virus, and I received a malware prevention alert confirming the file had been quarantined.

## Investigating Telemetry

To dive deeper, I went into the Discover tab in Kibana and filtered the logs to view recent events. There, I found the malware prevention alert with detailed information about the malicious file, including:
- File hash
- Quarantine path
- Directory (C:\Users\Public\Downloads)

In the Security tab, I also explored the process tree, which showed the relationship between the legitimate explorer.exe process and the blocked pilotvader.exe. If the malware had spawned other processes, they would have also appeared here.

## Isolating the Host

Next, I tested Elastic Defend's host isolation feature. After initiating an infinite ping to Google's DNS (8.8.8.8), I re-downloaded the malicious file, which Elastic Defend promptly quarantined again. Soon after, the host was isolated, demonstrating Elastic Defend's ability to take responsive action against threats.

## Conclusion

Day 29 was a valuable deep dive into Elastic Defend. I learned how to install, monitor, and test its EDR capabilities, reinforcing its importance for endpoint security. I'll wrap up the challenge tomorrow by reviewing troubleshooting techniques and fine-tuning detection strategies.

## Day 28 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Investigating the Mythic C2 Framework

## Overview

On Day 28 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I shifted my focus to the Mythic Command and Control (C2) framework. Attackers widely use this framework to maintain control over compromised systems, allowing them to execute commands, steal data, and conduct other malicious activities without detection. My task was to investigate how the Mythic agent svchost_pilotvader.exe operated and how its communication could be detected.

## Tracing the Mythic C2 Agent

My investigation's first step was locating the Mythic C2 agent on one of the compromised systems. Armed with the knowledge of the agent's name, I used the Kibana Discover tool to search through the logs, narrowing the time range to the past 30 days. This allowed me to pinpoint 25 distinct events associated with the agent. Sorting these events chronologically, I was able to reconstruct the timeline of the agent's activity, gaining critical insight into how it interacted with the system over time.

## Identifying C2 Traffic Through Network Telemetry

In cases where the agent's name isn't known, identifying suspicious traffic can be challenging. Network telemetry analysis plays a critical role in detecting C2 activity. I began by analyzing network logs to identify the "top talkers"—the machines that generated the most traffic. Since Mythic, like most C2 frameworks, relies on consistent communication between the infected host and the attacker's server, unusual traffic patterns often stand out.

To refine my detection, I utilized RITA (Real Intelligence Threat Analytics), a tool designed to detect beaconing behavior in C2 traffic. Beaconing occurs when an infected machine regularly checks in with a C2 server, and identifying these intervals allowed me to isolate Mythic's communication patterns. The detection of this regular network activity provided strong evidence of the C2 framework's presence.

## Investigating Process Creation Logs

Beyond network traffic, process creation analysis was essential for tracing the agent's activity. By examining these logs, I could see the exact processes initiated by the Mythic agent and track the attacker's movement within the system. These logs offer a detailed view of how the agent behaves, from its initial execution to spawning other processes critical to maintaining control over the system.

## Conclusion

Day 28's deep dive into the Mythic C2 framework offered valuable lessons in tracking adversary behavior. By leveraging network telemetry, beaconing detection, and process creation logs, I was able to uncover the activities of the Mythic agent and better understand its communication patterns. As the challenge nears its end, these investigations continue to hone my skills in threat detection and incident response.

## Day 27 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Investigating an RDP Brute Force Attack

## Overview

On Day 27 of my 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I shifted focus to investigating an RDP brute force attack alert. The process follows a similar methodology to investigating an SSH brute force attack, with the only major difference being the protocol in question. Here's how I broke it down.

## Reviewing the Alert

I started by navigating to the alerts section in my web interface, filtering for RDP brute force alerts. Out of 327 total alerts, I found 5 related to RDP brute force. I selected one of the alerts and also took note of the source IP, which had a username attempt of "administrator." There were 5 events in total, so I dug deeper into the details.

## Automating Ticket Creation in OS Ticket

Because I had already set up an automated ticket creation system for SSH brute force alerts, I decided to replicate the process for this RDP alert. Using the existing SSH rule, I copied the webhook details and applied them to the RDP brute force rule. This allowed me to automatically generate a ticket within OS Ticket whenever an RDP brute force attack is detected.

## Investigating the IP Address

For the next steps, I wanted to gather more information about the attacking IP address. First, I used AbuseIPDB, which revealed that the IP had been reported 71 times, with a 63% confidence score of malicious activity, mostly relating to RDP brute force attempts. Then, I checked GreyNoise, which classified the IP as "unknown intent," meaning it was engaged in internet-wide scanning but not specifically targeting my environment. This data gave me enough confidence to mark the IP as associated with RDP brute force activity.

## Analyzing for Affected Users

I next wanted to see if any other users were targeted by the attacker. After filtering my logs for the past 30 days, I found 271 events related to this IP, but all of them were focused on the "administrator" account. This confirmed that no other user accounts had been affected.

## Checking for Successful Logins

A crucial part of any brute force investigation is determining whether the attacker was successful. In this case, I looked for Windows event code 4624, which indicates a successful login. Fortunately, there were no successful authentication attempts from this IP address, so I could confirm that the attack had failed.

## Conclusion

Even though there were no successful logins in this case, the investigation served as a good reminder of the importance of thorough log review and automated alerting. In the next step of this challenge, I'll be diving deeper into another investigation, this time analyzing activity from the Mythic C2 agent. Stay tuned for more insights!
