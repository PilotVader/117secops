This step was crucial in establishing centralized authentication, DNS, DHCP, and Group Policy management within my segmented VLAN architecture. Following the structure of Gerard O'Brien's Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity Lab series, Episode 5, I adapted the process to fit my lab's unique VLAN assignments, IP addressing, and Proxmox-based virtualization environment. The result was a functional Windows Server Active Directory environment, complete with user accounts, security groups, DHCP migration, and automated drive mapping, all verified through a successful workstation domain join.\r\n\r\n### Building the Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller\r\n\r\nI began by provisioning a new virtual machine in Proxmox to host the domain controller. The VM was configured with Windows Server 2022 Standard (Desktop Experience) and allocated resources sufficient for Active Directory and supporting services. The network interface was connected to my vmbr0 bridge with VLAN 20 tagging to ensure isolation within the lab's network segmentation.\r\n\r\nDuring installation, the Windows setup process initially failed to detect any storage devices. This was due to the absence of necessary VirtIO drivers in the Windows installation media. To resolve this, I attached an additional virtual CD-ROM containing the VirtIO ISO, loaded the appropriate viostor driver for Windows Server 2022, and proceeded with the installation once the 64GB virtual disk became visible.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the installation and setting the initial administrator password, I confirmed that the server had obtained an IP address from my OPNsense firewall. I then reconfigured the NIC with a static IP of **10.10.20.10**, set the gateway to **10.10.20.254**, and assigned DNS to Google's public resolvers. The hostname was updated to Prod-DomainController and the server was rebooted to apply these changes.\r\n\r\nWith networking finalized, I launched Server Manager and used the \"Add Roles and Features\" wizard to install Active Directory Domain Services, DNS Server, and DHCP Server. The server was then promoted to a domain controller, creating a new forest with the domain name **samson.local** and a forest functional level set to Windows Server 2016.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={windows-server-deployment} title=\"Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller Deployment\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### User and Group Configuration\r\n\r\nOnce Active Directory was operational, I opened Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) and created a security group named \"Shared Folder Access,\" intended to control which users would automatically receive mapped network drives. I then created two accounts: a standard user account for workstation logins and a domain administrator account named SOAdmin, which was added to the Domain Admins group.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={user-group-configuration} title=\"User and Group Configuration in Active Directory\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Migrating DHCP from the Firewall to the Domain Controller\r\n\r\nPrior to this stage, DHCP for VLAN 20 was provided by my OPNsense firewall. To consolidate network services within the domain, I logged into OPNsense, disabled DHCP on VLAN 20, and configured a new DHCP scope on the domain controller. The scope covered IP addresses from **10.10.20.100** to **10.10.20.120**, used a subnet mask of **255.255.255.0**, and specified the default gateway as **10.10.20.254**. The domain controller itself was designated as the primary DNS server. This migration ensured that devices on VLAN 20 would now obtain addressing directly from Active Directory-integrated DHCP.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={dhcp-migration} title=\"DHCP Migration from Firewall to Domain Controller\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Implementing Group Policy for Drive Mapping\r\n\r\nTo automate network drive assignments for authorized users, I used Group Policy Management to create a new GPO named \"Map Network Drive.\" Under User Configuration → Preferences → Windows Settings → Drive Maps, I configured the policy to connect a G: drive to a shared folder on the domain controller. Item-Level Targeting was enabled so that only members of the \"Shared Folder Access\" security group would receive this mapping.\r\n\r\nThe shared folder itself was configured in the server's file system with full control permissions granted for the purposes of lab testing, acknowledging that in a production scenario, permissions would be far more restrictive.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={group-policy-drive-mapping} title=\"Group Policy Drive Mapping Configuration\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={group-policy-configuration} title=\"Group Policy and DHCP Configuration\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Deploying and Joining the Windows 10 Workstation\r\n\r\nThe Windows 10 desktop was provisioned in Proxmox with a network interface on VLAN 20 to ensure DHCP and domain connectivity. As with the domain controller installation, the Windows 10 setup required VirtIO storage drivers, which were loaded from an attached VirtIO ISO before installation could proceed.\r\n\r\nFollowing setup, I confirmed that the workstation received an IP address from the domain controller's DHCP service. I then joined the machine to the **Samson.local** domain by entering the domain name in the System Properties dialog and authenticating with the GEAdmin account. Upon reboot, the \"Other User\" option was used to log in with the standard domain account created earlier.\r\n\r\nThe login was successful, and as expected, the Group Policy applied automatically, mapping the G: drive to the shared folder on the domain controller. This confirmed that the domain join process was working correctly and that both DHCP and GPO-driven resource mapping were functioning as intended.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={windows-10-domain-join} title=\"Windows 10 Workstation Domain Integration\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"mb-4 leading-relaxed\"\u003eAt this stage, my lab's Windows Server 2022 domain controller and Windows 10 workstation were fully integrated into a functioning Active Directory environment.

Following the blueprint from Gerard O'Brien's Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity Lab series, I've reached one of the most exciting milestones so far: deploying MITRE Caldera for adversary emulation and Security Onion for network-based detection and threat hunting.\r\n\r\nBoth tools play crucial roles in a mature SOC workflow, and getting them online was a mix of straightforward installs, unexpected technical snags, and valuable troubleshooting lessons.\r\n\r\n### Deploying MITRE Caldera\r\n\r\nCaldera is an adversary emulation platform developed by MITRE, designed to simulate real-world attacker behaviours and techniques in a controlled environment. The goal in my lab is to use it to generate realistic attack traffic and test detection capabilities across my monitoring stack.\r\n\r\nWhile the transcript in the tutorial followed a clean, predictable installation of Caldera 4.2, my own journey involved a few detours.\r\n\r\n### Initial Setup and Configuration\r\n\r\nI provisioned a new Ubuntu Server VM in Proxmox with 8GB of RAM, two vCPUs, and a 50GB disk, connected to my VLAN 1 \"Security Tools\" network. This ensured that Caldera would have unrestricted communication with the rest of my detection infrastructure. The static IP for this server was set to **10.10.5.53**.\r\n\r\nAfter cloning the Caldera repository from GitHub and moving into its directory, I attempted to install dependencies with the command `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.\r\n\r\n### Overcoming Python Environment Issues\r\n\r\nThis is where I hit the first hurdle. Ubuntu 22.04 now ships with Python in a \"externally managed\" mode, meaning pip cannot directly install packages system-wide without bypassing the system package manager. The installation aborted with a message advising me to either use apt install for Debian packages or create a Python virtual environment.\r\n\r\nThe latter was the more controlled option, so I created and activated a virtual environment using these commands:\r\n\r\n`python3 -m venv venv`\r\n`source venv/bin/activate`\r\n\r\nWith the virtual environment active, pip installed the required packages cleanly. However, the next attempt to start Caldera using this command:\r\n\r\n`python3 server.py --insecure --build`\r\n\r\ntriggered another failure, this time related to a missing npm command. The --build flag instructs Caldera to compile its Vue.js frontend, but this requires Node.js and npm. Installing them inside the VM resolved the problem:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt install nodejs npm`\r\n\r\n### Final Deployment and Verification\r\n\r\nOnce Node.js was in place, I ran the build process again. The frontend compiled successfully, but npm threw network timeout errors at one point. This was due to npm's registry connection attempts failing intermittently, which I fixed by retrying the install after confirming the VM's DNS and gateway settings were correct.\r\n\r\nFinally, Caldera's web server launched without further issues, listening on port 8888. Accessing **http://10.10.5.53:8888** presented the login interface, where I could sign in as either the red team user (red:admin) or blue team user (blue:admin). This marked the successful deployment of Caldera 4.2, ready for later integration into attack simulation workflows.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={caldera-deployment} title=\"Caldera Deployment Walkthrough\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Installing Security Onion\r\n\r\nNext came Security Onion, a full-featured open-source platform for network security monitoring, intrusion detection, and threat hunting. Unlike Caldera's lightweight footprint, Security Onion's requirements are substantial—the standalone deployment calls for at least 16GB of RAM, four vCPUs, 200GB of storage, and dual network interfaces.\r\n\r\n### System Requirements and Preparation\r\n\r\nI created a new Proxmox VM meeting these specs and uploaded the latest Security Onion ISO. The primary NIC was connected to VLAN 1 for management, while a second NIC was reserved for potential sniffing or monitoring duties. Initially, I left the second NIC disconnected during installation to avoid known setup errors.\r\n\r\n### Installation Process\r\n\r\nThe installation process began with selecting \"Install Security Onion\" and providing a username, password, and other initial setup details. The configuration was set to STANDALONE mode, with the management interface assigned a static IP.\r\n\r\nThis is where an important adjustment was necessary. In the tutorial, the gateway was set to **10.10.1.254**, but in my network, the correct gateway for VLAN 1 is **10.10.5.254**. Using the wrong gateway would have left the system unable to route traffic correctly. DNS servers included my OPNsense firewall (**192.168.1.1**) and public resolvers (**8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4**).\r\n\r\nAfter confirming the settings, the installation began, and this was not a quick process. Despite being on modern hardware, Security Onion's post-install configuration took over two hours to complete, performing extensive service installations, database setups, and Elastic Stack provisioning. Patience was essential here.\r\n\r\n### Accessing the Platform\r\n\r\nWhen the setup finally completed, I accessed the web interface by navigating to **https://10.10.5.54** from a browser on my management network. Logging in with the credentials created earlier presented the full Security Onion dashboard, ready to begin ingesting data from across the lab.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={security-onion-deployment} title=\"Security Onion Deployment Walkthrough\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"mb-4 leading-relaxed\"\u003eAt this point, I had successfully deployed both Caldera and Security Onion in my cybersecurity home lab. Caldera was operational and ready for adversary emulation, while Security Onion was configured for network-based detection and threat hunting. Both tools were integrated within my segmented VLAN architecture, providing a solid foundation for advanced security testing and monitoring.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"mb-4 leading-relaxed\"\u003eThis project showcases the real-world challenges of deploying complex security tools in a home lab environment. The dependency issues with Python's managed mode and the resource-intensive nature of Security Onion highlighted the importance of proper planning and patience in cybersecurity engineering. The next phase will involve integrating these tools with Wazuh, running simulated attack campaigns, and validating that alerts are generated and correlated correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"mb-4 leading-relaxed\"\u003eStay tuned for the next stage of this project as we include our Windows Server and Windows 10 environment.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"mb-4 leading-relaxed\"\u003e\u003cstrong class=\"font-semibold\"\u003eCredits:\u003c/strong\u003e This walkthrough is based on Episode 4 of the Ultimate Cybersecurity Lab YouTube series by Gerard O'Brien.

I provisioned a new Ubuntu server virtual machine on Proxmox with 4 vCPUs, 8GB of RAM, and 160GB of disk space, ensuring it resided within VLAN 5 (my security tools network) using the IP 10.10.5.51/24. The Wazuh installation process was straightforward. After setting a static IP and configuring DNS and gateway entries, I initiated a basic update and upgrade cycle, then ran the official Wazuh installation script from their GitHub repository.\n\nOnce the installation was completed, I accessed the Wazuh dashboard via HTTPS at https://10.10.5.51, authenticated using the auto-generated credentials, and confirmed a successful deployment. With the Wazuh manager operational, the next step was deploying agents across key systems in the lab.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={wazuh-server-deployment} title=\"Wazuh Server Deployment\" /\u003e\n\n### Deploying Agents: Parrot OS and Docker Server Integration\n\nThe first endpoint I configured was my Parrot OS. I elevated to root and ran the prescribed commands to add the Wazuh repository, perform an update, and install the agent. I edited the agent configuration to point it at the Wazuh manager IP and verified connectivity. Upon launching the agent, it registered on the Wazuh dashboard and began transmitting logs shortly after.\n\nI replicated the same process on my Ubuntu Docker server (10.10.30.100), again ensuring root privileges, repository addition, and agent configuration. I initiated the agent and confirmed its visibility on the Wazuh interface. To extend observability into containerised environments, I proceeded to install the Wazuh Docker Listener and configured the Docker API for telemetry ingestion. I appended the required JSON configuration into the agent's config file, restarted the service, and enabled the module on the Wazuh dashboard under Settings \u003e Modules \u003e Docker Listener. Container-level logs began appearing as I restarted a few test containers to validate.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={agent-installation} title=\"Agent Installation Process\" /\u003e\n\n### OPNsense Firewall Agent Issues: Encountering the PID File Roadblock\n\nWith both endpoint systems operational in Wazuh, I turned my attention to integrating my OPNsense firewall (192.168.1.1) running on dedicated hardware. This step diverged significantly from the Linux-based agents, as it required enabling FreeBSD repositories and handling configuration in a constrained BSD environment. I SSHed into OPNsense, enabled SSH under System \u003e Advanced, and modified the FreeBSD.conf file to set enabled=YES. Unlike the tutorial, I found only the freebsd.conf file available, not pfsense.conf, due to architectural differences between OPNsense and pfSense.\n\nFollowing the installation instructions, I attempted to run the agent-auth binary to register the agent with the manager. However, I encountered a persistent error: agent-auth: CRITICAL (1212): Unable to create PID file. This indicated a permission or filesystem-level issue preventing the Wazuh agent from properly initialising. Further troubleshooting revealed that the ossec user and group did not exist by default. Attempts to assign ownership using chown -R ossec:ossec /var/ossec returned \"illegal group name\" errors.\n\nI manually verified write permissions by creating and removing test files under /var/ossec, which confirmed basic functionality. Despite that, the Wazuh agent daemon (wazuh-agentd) consistently failed to start. Configuration and log file reviews pointed to missing or incompatible startup routines specific to FreeBSD. I eventually confirmed that even after enabling FreeBSD package support and properly configuring ossec.conf to include the manager IP, the agent appeared on the Wazuh dashboard but failed to show \"Active\" status.\n\nAt this point, I decided to temporarily pause work on the OPNsense agent integration. The issue remained unresolved, likely due to deeper compatibility mismatches or required kernel parameters not present on the OPNsense BSD environment. I plan to revisit this with a custom-built FreeBSD agent installation script or by manually creating missing users and startup routines. But if anyone has encountered this issue, please reach out to me with suggestions, I'll really appreciate.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={opnsense-setup} title=\"OPNsense Firewall Configuration\" /\u003e\n\n### Deploying Nessus: Introducing Vulnerability Scanning to the Lab\n\nWith the SIEM side in partial production, I progressed to deploying Nessus for vulnerability scanning. I created a new Ubuntu VM on Proxmox with 4 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM, and 40 GB disk, assigning it the IP address 10.10.5.52/24 within VLAN 5. After configuring static networking and enabling SSH, I logged in and ran the commands to download the latest Nessus Debian package. I installed it using dpkg and started the nessusd service.\n\nAccessing Nessus via the browser at https://10.10.5.52:8834 allowed me to register for the Essentials version and input the activation key. The platform then began downloading its full set of plugins and signature files. Once installation was completed, I created a quick scan targeting the Metasploitable2 VM. Even with the basic scan template, the results after the scan show that it was successful even with limited information, confirming its functionality.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={nessus-deployment} title=\"Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Setup\" /\u003e\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAt this point, I had a partially complete security monitoring stack within my home lab. Wazuh was successfully collecting logs from my Parrot OS and Docker machines and even parsing Docker container activity. Nessus was active and ready to scan targets across VLAN 5. However, OPNsense integration remained incomplete due to agent startup issues tied to BSD permission handling. I plan to circle back to this issue later with a deeper understanding of BSD service management or possibly using Syslog forwarding as a temporary workaround.\n\nThis project showcases the real-world challenges of building a hybrid monitoring environment, integrating both Linux and BSD-based systems into a centralised SIEM. It's a valuable case study for anyone deploying Wazuh in a segmented network and dealing with heterogeneous operating systems. My next step will be to document the resolution of the OPNsense agent issue and expand Wazuh's use to include alert rule tuning and dashboard customisation.\n\nStay tuned for the next stage of this project as we integrate more detection and response tools.\n\n**Credits:** This walkthrough is based on Episode 3 of the Ultimate Cybersecurity Lab YouTube series by Gerard O'Brien.

Using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), the purpose of this hunt was to determine whether the performance degradation was caused by malicious internal activity, excessive resource usage, or misconfigured systems.\n\nThe environment consisted of my onboarded virtual machine named samson-windows-1, which was actively reporting telemetry to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. The goal was to use real-time logs and threat hunting queries to identify abnormal behaviors that could suggest internal reconnaissance, port scanning, or other unauthorized actions within the network.\n\nThis scenario demonstrates a practical application of endpoint detection and response (EDR) data in uncovering internal security issues and applying structured analysis techniques to isolate potential causes.\n\n## Scenario Overview\n\nThe issue began when the server team observed an overall slowdown across multiple legacy devices in the 10.0.0.0/16 subnet. External DDoS attacks were ruled out, meaning the cause was likely internal. The unrestricted internal network environment, where all hosts could communicate freely and PowerShell was allowed without restriction, created a perfect scenario for internal misuse or exploitation.\n\nThe working hypothesis for this hunt was that one of the systems inside the local network could have been performing unauthorized port scanning or large data transfers, which would naturally create latency or bandwidth congestion. The objective was to identify the specific device responsible for this unusual activity and determine whether it was a deliberate or automated action.\n\n## Preparation\n\nBefore starting the hunt, I ensured that my virtual machine, samson-windows-, was properly onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Once confirmed, I simulated an internal event by executing a PowerShell command designed to initiate a controlled port scan within the local subnet. This step was necessary to generate realistic logs for analysis, mimicking what a real-world internal threat might look like.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={vm-setup-onboarding} title=\"VM Setup and Microsoft Defender Onboarding Process\" /\u003e\n\n### PowerShell Command\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\npowershell\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/portscan.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\\programdata\\portscan.ps1';cmd /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\programdata\\portscan.ps1\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis PowerShell command downloaded and executed a script that scanned a range of IPs within the 10.0.0.x subnet, sequentially probing ports on other devices. In a real enterprise setting, this would represent a potential reconnaissance operation, something commonly done by attackers or misconfigured tools trying to map network exposure.\n\nAfter executing the command, I allowed several minutes for the resulting logs to populate in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's hunting tables. The preparation phase was crucial, as it ensured that the system had generated enough telemetry to analyze behaviors such as failed connection attempts, sequential port scanning, and process execution traces.\n\n## Data Collection\n\nOnce the environment was prepared, the next phase involved verifying that telemetry data was actively being received across the three key Defender tables: DeviceNetworkEvents, DeviceFileEvents, and DeviceProcessEvents.\n\nI began by executing a simple query to confirm that new logs were flowing in correctly. By ordering results by timestamp and taking the most recent entries, I could confirm that MDE was actively collecting data and that there were no ingestion delays.\n\n### KQL Check for Recent Network Logs\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nkql\nDeviceNetworkEvents\n| order by Timestamp desc\n| take 10\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe timestamps confirmed that logs were being generated in real time. Having verified the data sources, I was confident that the environment was providing the necessary visibility to conduct meaningful analysis.\n\nIn a real security operations environment, this phase mimics ensuring that sensors and logging mechanisms are functioning correctly before an investigation begins. Without fresh telemetry, an analyst could end up drawing conclusions from outdated or incomplete information.\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nThe analysis phase began with looking for signs of network anomalies, specifically focusing on connection attempts that had either failed or succeeded in large quantities. A sudden burst of such activity could be indicative of scanning or enumeration attempts within the network.\n\n### KQL – Count Failed Connections\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nkql\nDeviceNetworkEvents\n| where ActionType == \"ConnectionFailed\"\n| summarize FailedConnectionsAttempts = count() by DeviceName, ActionType, LocalIP, RemoteIP\n| order by FailedConnectionsAttempts desc\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen the results came back, the data immediately pointed to samson-windows- as the primary contributor to abnormal connection failures. The logs revealed that the device had failed over a hundred connection attempts, some directed at its own IP address and others toward another host in the subnet. Such behavior was a strong indicator of either misconfiguration or automated probing.\n\nTo further understand the scope of the activity, I drilled down into specific IP addresses that exhibited the highest failure rates. This approach mirrors a real-world scenario where analysts pivot from a general pattern to a specific anomaly for deeper inspection.\n\n### KQL – Inspect All Failed Connections from a Specific IP\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nkql\nlet IPInQuestion = \"10.0.0.5\";\nDeviceNetworkEvents\n| where ActionType == \"ConnectionFailed\"\n| where LocalIP == IPInQuestion\n| order by Timestamp desc\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpon reviewing the sequence of failed connection attempts, it became clear that the remote ports being contacted followed a sequential pattern: ports 21, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 443, and others. This pattern matched the signature of a port scanning activity, which is typically used to identify open services running across hosts. Sequential probing of well-known ports is rarely accidental and often indicates reconnaissance or mapping behavior within the network.\n\nAt this stage, I had high confidence that the slowdown was caused by internal scanning originating from the samson-windows- VM.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={network-investigation-analysis} title=\"Network Investigation and Analysis Process\" /\u003e\n\n## Investigation\n\nTo confirm the origin of this suspicious activity, I pivoted to the DeviceProcessEvents table to look for the process responsible for initiating these connections. By focusing on a specific time window surrounding the detected network anomalies, I aimed to identify any executable or script that matched the port scanning behavior.\n\n### KQL – Correlate Process Activity around the Port Scan Time\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nkql\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\nlet specificTime = datetime(2025-10-12T13:15:03.9576325Z);\nDeviceProcessEvents\n| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 10m) .. (specificTime + 10m))\n| where DeviceName == VMName\n| order by Timestamp desc\n| project Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe query output revealed that a PowerShell script named portscan.ps1 had been executed under the System account. This was a significant finding because the System account generally has administrative-level privileges and is not typically used to execute network scanning scripts.\n\nUpon logging into the VM, I located the file in C:\\ProgramData\\portscan.ps1 and reviewed its contents. The script was intentionally scanning hosts in the subnet, sequentially testing common ports. This confirmed that the slowdown was caused by repeated internal scanning initiated by the PowerShell script.\n\n### Snippet of the observed PowerShell script:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\npowershell\nfor ($i=4; $i -le 10; $i++) {\n   Test-NetConnection \"10.0.0.$i\" -Port 21,23,25,53,80,110,443\n}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSince the script was running under the System account and not triggered by an identifiable user, I concluded that the activity was automated and potentially malicious. I proceeded to isolate the samson-windows- VM from the network using Defender for Endpoint's built-in Isolate Device feature.\n\nAfter isolating the system, I ran a full malware scan to check for persistence mechanisms or additional payloads. The scan returned clean, but ideally you are to request a full rebuild of the VM. In a production setting, this step ensures that any potential hidden or dormant artifacts are fully removed.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={port-scan-investigation-isolation} title=\"Port Scan Investigation and Device Isolation Process\" /\u003e\n\n## Response and MITRE ATT\u0026CK Mapping\n\nThis scenario corresponded with several techniques in the MITRE ATT\u0026CK Framework, helping align the observed activity with recognized adversarial tactics:\n\n1. **Reconnaissance (T1046 – Network Service Scanning)**: The port scanning activity represented a clear attempt to enumerate open services.\n2. **Execution (T1059.001 – PowerShell)**: The PowerShell script was used as the execution medium for network probing.\n3. **Privilege Escalation (T1078 – Valid Accounts / System Context)**: The script ran under the System account, suggesting a high privilege level.\n4. **Lateral Movement (T1021 – Remote Services)**: The scanning pattern indicated attempts to discover reachable hosts for potential lateral movement.\n\nBy isolating the device, scanning for malware, and scheduling a reimage, the risk of any further impact was neutralized.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThroughout the course of this investigation, I documented every major step and observation to ensure a clear understanding of how the event unfolded. The investigation began with an initial hypothesis of possible internal misuse, which evolved into the discovery of systematic port scanning. Each query used in Defender for Endpoint was recorded alongside its findings to form an evidence trail.\n\nThis documentation not only captured the technical steps taken, such as verifying logs, pivoting between tables, and confirming the script execution but also reflected the reasoning behind each action. Maintaining detailed documentation like this allows for transparency, consistency, and reproducibility in future hunts. It also helps build reference material that can be used by other analysts for similar incidents, ensuring the organization's knowledge base grows with every investigation.\n\n## Improvement\n\nAfter analyzing the entire scenario, several improvement points were identified. First, it became clear that PowerShell execution policies were too relaxed in this environment. Restricting PowerShell to only run signed scripts would immediately reduce the risk of arbitrary script execution.\n\nSecond, the internal network lacked segmentation, allowing one compromised host to communicate freely with all others. In a real corporate setup, proper network segmentation would ensure that unnecessary east-west traffic is limited and monitored.\n\nThird, implementing automated alerting for abnormal internal traffic patterns, such as repeated connection failures to sequential ports, would enable the SOC team to detect similar behavior earlier. Additionally, conducting proactive threat hunts on a routine basis helps catch reconnaissance activities before they evolve into actual compromise events.\n\nUltimately, this scenario reinforced the importance of combining technical detection with procedural discipline, ensuring every hunt improves the overall security posture of the environment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe sudden network slowdown was traced to a PowerShell-based port scanning script executed under the System account on samson-windows-. Although no active compromise was found, the activity realistically simulated how internal reconnaissance could degrade performance and increase exposure within an unrestricted network.\n\nThis hunt demonstrated the power of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in identifying behavioral anomalies, correlating telemetry across different data sources, and facilitating immediate containment actions.\n\nThrough structured investigation and methodical documentation, this exercise emphasized how internal misconfigurations or unauthorized automation can lead to observable network symptoms, and how disciplined threat hunting can quickly uncover their root cause.\n\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"9:[\"$\",\"$L12\",null,{\"projectData\":{\"slug\":\"project-4-6-windows-server-2022-windows-10-domain-integration\",\"title\":\"Project 4.6:
