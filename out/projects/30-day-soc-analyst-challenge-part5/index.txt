## Day 5 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Deploying Windows Server in the Cloud.

Day 5 of the challenge focused on deploying a Windows Server instance in the cloud, with a particular emphasis on network security and architecture decisions. This setup would serve as a target machine for generating security logs and analyzing potential threats.

## Initial Setup and Network Architecture

I began by logging into my Vultr account and preparing to set up a new Windows Server instance. The first crucial decision involved determining whether to include this server in our previously configured Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Our instructor provided valuable insights into network architecture, highlighting the importance of network segmentation and security.

## Security Considerations

The core concept we explored was network isolation and its role in security. By keeping the Windows Server separate from the VPC, we could better protect our internal network from potential threats. This isolation is particularly crucial because internet exposure increases the server's risk profile, and separation prevents lateral movement in case of compromise. It effectively reduces the overall attack surface and provides better damage control in case of a breach.

## Deployment Configuration

With these security considerations in mind, I proceeded with the deployment. I deployed the server outside the VPC, configuring it without private IP address space connection. The server was set up with public IP access only, and I accessed it through Vultr's console. This configuration aligned with our security-first approach to the deployment.

## Remote Access Setup

The next critical step was configuring Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access. I exposed RDP to the internet for remote management, fully acknowledging the increased attack surface this would create. This setup was intentional, as it would allow the server to generate security logs from various access attempts. After configuration, I verified that RDP functionality was working as expected.

## Next Steps

The server is now operational and will begin accumulating logs from various access attempts. These logs will be crucial for analyzing unauthorized access attempts, identifying potential threats, and developing security monitoring strategies. This data will form the foundation for our future analysis exercises.

## Conclusion

This day's work established a crucial component of our security lab - a Windows Server instance that will generate real-world security logs. The careful consideration of network architecture and security implications provided valuable insights into enterprise security practices. In the next session, I'll be configuring a Fleet Server to enhance our lab's endpoint management capabilities.

## Day 29 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Installing and Exploring Elastic Defend on Windows Server

## Overview

On Day 29, I focused on Elastic's Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) toolâElastic Defend. This powerful EDR solution offers comprehensive endpoint protection and valuable telemetry to help monitor and respond to threats.

## Setting Up Elastic Defend

Elastic Defend is part of the Elastic Stack, and with the free 30-day trial, I could unlock additional features like full telemetry and host isolation. To get started, I accessed the Integrations section in Elastic, From there, I added Elastic Defend to my environment. Elastic Defend offers several configuration options, including:
- Data Collection
- Next-Gen Antivirus
- Essential EDR
- Complete EDR

For this challenge, I chose Complete EDR, I then deployed Elastic Defend to my Windows Server using a Fleet server, allowing centralized management of multiple endpoints.

## Monitoring and Testing

With Elastic Defend successfully installed, I checked the Security section in Kibana to ensure the endpoint appeared, confirming the agent was active. Elastic Defend offers multiple actions, including the ability to isolate the host, which is available with the trial version.

I wanted to test Elastic Defend's malware detection capabilities, so I ran the pilotvader.exe process on my Windows Server, simulating a malicious action. As expected, Elastic Defend instantly flagged and blocked the file. A message appeared stating that the operation couldn't be completed because the file contained a virus, and I received a malware prevention alert confirming the file had been quarantined.

## Investigating Telemetry

To dive deeper, I went into the Discover tab in Kibana and filtered the logs to view recent events. There, I found the malware prevention alert with detailed information about the malicious file, including:
- File hash
- Quarantine path
- Directory (C:\Users\Public\Downloads)

In the Security tab, I also explored the process tree, which showed the relationship between the legitimate explorer.exe process and the blocked pilotvader.exe. If the malware had spawned other processes, they would have also appeared here.

## Isolating the Host

Next, I tested Elastic Defend's host isolation feature. After initiating an infinite ping to Google's DNS (8.8.8.8), I re-downloaded the malicious file, which Elastic Defend promptly quarantined again. Soon after, the host was isolated, demonstrating Elastic Defend's ability to take responsive action against threats.

## Conclusion

Day 29 was a valuable deep dive into Elastic Defend. I learned how to install, monitor, and test its EDR capabilities, reinforcing its importance for endpoint security. I'll wrap up the challenge tomorrow by reviewing troubleshooting techniques and fine-tuning detection strategies.

## Day 24 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Setting Up and Configuring OS Ticket

## Overview

On Day 24 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge! I'll dive into OS Ticket, a ticketing system that will be an essential tool for my SOC operations. The aim is to set up OS Ticket successfully and configure it on a Windows Server. This system will streamline ticket management for the alerts we'll deal with throughout the challenge. Let's get started!

## Deploying the Server

The first step in setting up OS Ticket is to deploy a server. I used Vulture for this process, selecting "Cloud Compute" with a shared CPU and Windows Server 2022. The server specifications don't need to be too powerful; I chose 1 CPU and 2 GB of memory. After selecting a location and setting up firewall configurations, the server was ready for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access.

## Setting Up the Web Server

Once connected to the server, I installed XAMPP, a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution. XAMPP makes it easy to set up Apache, MySQL, and PHP, all necessary for OS Ticket to function. After downloading XAMPP, I configured it by:

- Changing the Apache domain name to my server's public IP address
- Modifying the phpMyAdmin configuration to ensure secure access from my SOC analyst laptop

## Configuring Firewall Rules

Before moving further, I created inbound firewall rules for ports 80 and 443. This ensures that only authorized devices can access the web server. With XAMPP running, I started both the Apache and MySQL services and verified that everything was configured correctly.

## Installing OS Ticket

Next, I downloaded OS Ticket from their official site, choosing the latest stable version. After extracting the files, I moved them to the XAMPP htdocs folder to be served by the Apache server. Once the web server was up and running, I accessed the OS Ticket setup page, which prompted me to configure the system. This included:

- Renaming configuration files
- Setting up a MySQL database for OS Ticket to store data

## Finalizing the Installation

With the database created and the necessary configurations in place, the final step was to run the OS Ticket installation. After entering admin details and configuring the database connection, the OS Ticket was successfully installed. I also ensured file permissions were properly set for security.

## Conclusion

With this system, I'll be able to manage SOC alerts efficiently. Up next, I'll explore how to integrate OS Ticket with my tech stack so that alerts automatically generate tickets.

## Day 20 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Setting Up Mythic C2

## Overview

On Day 20 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I set up Mythic C2, a command-and-control (C2) framework. This day's challenge was focused on getting familiar with the Mythic interface, installing it on a cloud server, and tightening its security configurations.

## Deploying Mythic on Vulture Cloud

The first step was logging into the Vulture cloud provider and deploying a new server. I opted for Cloud Compute with a shared CPU, choosing Ubuntu with 4GB of RAM. After naming the server and starting the deployment, I prepared to install Kali Linux on my machine.

## Installing Kali Linux

I headed to the official Kali site and downloaded the VMware version for the Kali Linux setup, as I would run it on a virtual machine. After extracting the download, I loaded the .vmx file into VMware Workstation, started Kali, and ensured it ran smoothly.

## SSH Into Mythic Server

With the Mythic server ready on Vulture, I accessed it using SSH through PowerShell. After logging in, I updated the system repositories with apt-get update and apt-get upgrade. I then installed Docker, Docker Compose, and the make tool to ensure Mythic would run correctly.

## Installing Mythic

Next, I cloned the Mythic repository from GitHub and navigated into the directory. The installation process was initiated using a shell script designed for Docker on Ubuntu. Once the installation was completed, I encountered a minor issue with Docker not starting but resolved it by restarting the service.

## Configuring Mythic

With Mythic running, I began configuring the system. To enhance security, I created a custom firewall rule that only allowed my machine and specific agents to communicate with the Mythic server. This step ensured that no unauthorized IPs could attempt to access the server.

## Accessing Mythic's Web GUI

Finally, I logged into Mythic's web GUI using the server's IP and port 7443. I retrieved the login credentials from the environment variables stored on the server and successfully accessed the dashboard, where I explored the various options for managing payloads, callbacks, and more.

## Conclusion

With Mythic C2 set up and configured, I'm now ready to start generating payloads and testing them against our Windows server in future challenges. This setup is crucial for understanding C2 frameworks and is a key step for any SOC analyst. Stay tuned as I dive deeper into Mythic's capabilities in the upcoming challenges!
