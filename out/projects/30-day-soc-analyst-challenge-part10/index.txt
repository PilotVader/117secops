## Day 10 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Ingesting Sysmon and Microsoft Defender Logs

On Day 10 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I focused on ingesting both Sysmon and Microsoft Defender event logs from the Windows Server into my Elasticsearch instance. This step is crucial for centralizing log data and enhancing my ability to detect and analyze potential security threats.

## Setting Up Custom Windows Event Log Integrations

I began by logging into the Elasticsearch instance and navigating to the Integrations page. I searched for and selected the "Custom Windows Event log" integration, which allows ingesting events from any Windows Event log channel.

For Sysmon, I created an integration named "my-dfir-win-sysmon" with the channel name "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational". For Windows Defender, I set up another integration named "my-dfir-win-defender" with the channel "Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational". In the Defender integration, I specified event IDs 1116, 1117, and 5001 to focus on malware detection and real-time protection status.

## Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues

Initially, no logs appeared in Elasticsearch. Upon investigating, I discovered that the Elastic agent on the Windows Server couldn't communicate with the Elasticsearch instance. The solution was to add a firewall rule allowing incoming connections to port 9200 on the Elasticsearch server. After implementing this change and restarting the Elastic agent service, logs began flowing into Elasticsearch.

## Verifying Log Ingestion

To confirm successful log ingestion, I used Elasticsearch's Discover page. I searched for Sysmon events with the query "winlog.event_id: 1" and for Windows Defender events with "winlog.event_id: 5001". Both queries returned results, confirming that the logs were being correctly ingested and indexed.

## Conclusion

With Sysmon and Microsoft Defender logs now being successfully ingested into Elasticsearch, I have significantly improved my ability to monitor and analyze security events on my Windows Server. This centralized log collection will be instrumental in detecting and investigating potential security incidents in the future.

In the next part of this challenge, I'll explore how to effectively query and analyze these logs within Elasticsearch, further enhancing my SOC analysis capabilities.

## Day 9 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Installing and Configuring Sysmon on Windows Server

On Day 9 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I focused on setting up Sysmon on the Windows Server created on Day 5. Sysmon is a powerful tool from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite that enhances endpoint visibility by logging key activities such as process creation, network connections, and more. Here's how I did it.

## Downloading and Installing Sysmon

First, I connected to the Windows Server via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Once connected, I opened Microsoft Edge and searched for Sysmon on the Microsoft Learn site. I then downloaded the latest version of Sysmon (version 15.15 as of this writing) and extracted the contents to a directory on the server.

With the files extracted, I turned my attention to configuring Sysmon. I opted to use Olaf Hartong's popular Sysmon configuration file, which can be found on GitHub. This configuration file is widely used and highly customizable, allowing me to specify which events Sysmon should monitor.

## Configuring Sysmon

After downloading the configuration file (sysmonconfig.xml), I saved it in the Sysmon directory. I then opened PowerShell as an administrator and navigated to the directory where Sysmon was installed.

To install Sysmon with the configuration file, I used the following command in PowerShell:
```
sysmon64.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml
```

This command installs Sysmon and applies the configuration file. Once installed, Sysmon immediately begins logging events as per the configuration.

## Verifying Installation

To confirm that Sysmon was successfully installed, I checked both the Windows Services and Event Viewer. Sysmon appeared as a running service in the Services application. In Event Viewer, under Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon, I verified that Sysmon was actively generating logs, starting with Event ID 3, which logs network connections.

## Conclusion

With Sysmon now installed and logging critical events, the Windows Server is better equipped for monitoring and detecting malicious activities. In the next step of this challenge, I will learn how to push both Sysmon and Microsoft Defender logs to my Elasticsearch instance, enhancing my visibility and analysis capabilities.

## Day 17 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Building a Dashboard for RDP And SSH Activity

## Overview

Today I focused on creating a dashboard to monitor Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell (SSH) activity. This is critical for understanding authentication attempts on the Windows Server set up earlier in the challenge. Here's how I did it.

## Querying for Failed RDP Authentication Attempts

The first step was to log into the Elastic web GUI. I navigated to the "Maps" section by clicking the hamburger icon on the left sidebar. Since I needed to query for failed RDP attempts, I returned to the "Discover" tab to check a previous query. Using the search for failed authentication attempts, I retrieved a query using the event code 4625, which represents failed logon events in Windows.

With the query set, I added a new layer to my map. I chose "world countries" as the boundary and the country ISO code as the join field, allowing me to see where the failed RDP attempts were coming from. The results were striking, over 131,276 failed attempts from Ukraine alone!

## Querying for Successful RDP Authentication Attempts

Next, I needed to monitor successful RDP logins. I used the event code 4624, which represents successful logons. However, to specifically track RDP logins, I focused on logon types 10 and 7, which are associated with RDP connections. I updated the query to look for successful authentications of these types.

After running the query in the "Discover" tab, I saved it and moved it to the dashboard. I duplicated the earlier failed authentication dashboard and updated the query with my new one for successful RDP logins. Once saved, the dashboard displayed successful RDP connections, including their geographical origin — in my case, the United Kingdom.

## Adding a Table for Easier Analysis

To enhance my dashboard, I added a table showing the username, source IP, and country for each failed and successful RDP attempt. In the "Discover" tab, I created a new search query for failed attempts using event code 4625 and then did the same for successful attempts.

I added these saved searches to the dashboard and arranged them as tables beneath the maps. This gave me a clearer view of which usernames were being targeted and from which countries. Finally, I sorted the data to display the top values, showing the most frequent IP addresses and usernames involved in failed and successful logins.

## Conclusion

By setting up dashboards for both failed and successful RDP and SSH attempts, I can now better monitor authentication activity on my Windows Server. With this visibility, I am equipped to detect potential threats, particularly from brute force attacks on RDP and SSH. Next, I'll dive into command and control (C2) techniques using Mythic's framework.

## Day 16 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Windows Authentication Logs and RDP/SSH Brute Force Alerts

## Overview

On Day 16 of our challenge, I delved into the task of analyzing Windows authentication logs and creating alerts for RDP and SSH Brute Force attempts. This exercise built upon our previous work, further improving my skills as a SOC analyst.

## Analyzing Windows Authentication Logs

I began by accessing the Elastic web GUI and filtering events specifically for my Windows RDP server. My primary objective was to identify failed authentication attempts, which are key indicators of potential Brute Force activities. Through my research, I discovered that Event ID 4625 is associated with failed logon attempts on Windows systems, providing me with a specific marker to focus on.

## Customizing Data View

To gain a comprehensive understanding of these failed attempts, I tailored my data view in Elastic. I focused on three critical pieces of information:
- The failed attempts themselves (represented by Event ID 4625)
- The source IP address of the login attempt
- The username being targeted

This customized view allowed me to quickly assess the nature and scope of potential attacks. I then verified my setup by performing a test login attempt, ensuring that my system accurately captured RDP-specific events.

## Creating RDP And SSH Brute Force Alerts

My initial approach involved setting up a basic alert that would trigger when Event ID 4625 occurred more than five times within a five-minute window. However, I quickly realized that this alert lacked the detail necessary for effective threat analysis.

To address this, I developed an enhanced custom rule. This improved alert incorporated specific usernames, such as "administrator," and grouped events by both source IP and username. I also increased the frequency of our checks, configuring the system to analyze data every minute while looking back over five minutes.

## Conclusion

Through this exercise, I gained several valuable insights:
- The importance of fine-tuning alerts to provide truly actionable information
- A deeper understanding of various authentication event IDs and their significance in Windows environments
- The value of correlating events across multiple data points for a more comprehensive picture
- The need for continuous refinement of alert systems to minimize false positives

As I move forward, our next session will focus on creating dashboards to visualize the sources of these authentication attempts, further enhancing my ability to detect and respond to threats efficiently.
