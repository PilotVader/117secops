## Day 17 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Building a Dashboard for RDP And SSH Activity

## Overview

Today I focused on creating a dashboard to monitor Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell (SSH) activity. This is critical for understanding authentication attempts on the Windows Server set up earlier in the challenge. Here's how I did it.

## Querying for Failed RDP Authentication Attempts

The first step was to log into the Elastic web GUI. I navigated to the "Maps" section by clicking the hamburger icon on the left sidebar. Since I needed to query for failed RDP attempts, I returned to the "Discover" tab to check a previous query. Using the search for failed authentication attempts, I retrieved a query using the event code 4625, which represents failed logon events in Windows.

With the query set, I added a new layer to my map. I chose "world countries" as the boundary and the country ISO code as the join field, allowing me to see where the failed RDP attempts were coming from. The results were striking, over 131,276 failed attempts from Ukraine alone!

## Querying for Successful RDP Authentication Attempts

Next, I needed to monitor successful RDP logins. I used the event code 4624, which represents successful logons. However, to specifically track RDP logins, I focused on logon types 10 and 7, which are associated with RDP connections. I updated the query to look for successful authentications of these types.

After running the query in the "Discover" tab, I saved it and moved it to the dashboard. I duplicated the earlier failed authentication dashboard and updated the query with my new one for successful RDP logins. Once saved, the dashboard displayed successful RDP connections, including their geographical origin â in my case, the United Kingdom.

## Adding a Table for Easier Analysis

To enhance my dashboard, I added a table showing the username, source IP, and country for each failed and successful RDP attempt. In the "Discover" tab, I created a new search query for failed attempts using event code 4625 and then did the same for successful attempts.

I added these saved searches to the dashboard and arranged them as tables beneath the maps. This gave me a clearer view of which usernames were being targeted and from which countries. Finally, I sorted the data to display the top values, showing the most frequent IP addresses and usernames involved in failed and successful logins.

## Conclusion

By setting up dashboards for both failed and successful RDP and SSH attempts, I can now better monitor authentication activity on my Windows Server. With this visibility, I am equipped to detect potential threats, particularly from brute force attacks on RDP and SSH. Next, I'll dive into command and control (C2) techniques using Mythic's framework.

#CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #MYDFIRChallenge #HandsOnExperience #Day17 15:Tc06,
## Day 16 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Windows Authentication Logs and RDP/SSH Brute Force Alerts

## Overview

On Day 16 of our challenge, I delved into the task of analyzing Windows authentication logs and creating alerts for RDP and SSH Brute Force attempts. This exercise built upon our previous work, further improving my skills as a SOC analyst.

## Analyzing Windows Authentication Logs

I began by accessing the Elastic web GUI and filtering events specifically for my Windows RDP server. My primary objective was to identify failed authentication attempts, which are key indicators of potential Brute Force activities. Through my research, I discovered that Event ID 4625 is associated with failed logon attempts on Windows systems, providing me with a specific marker to focus on.

## Customizing Data View

To gain a comprehensive understanding of these failed attempts, I tailored my data view in Elastic. I focused on three critical pieces of information:
- The failed attempts themselves (represented by Event ID 4625)
- The source IP address of the login attempt
- The username being targeted

This customized view allowed me to quickly assess the nature and scope of potential attacks. I then verified my setup by performing a test login attempt, ensuring that my system accurately captured RDP-specific events.

## Creating RDP And SSH Brute Force Alerts

My initial approach involved setting up a basic alert that would trigger when Event ID 4625 occurred more than five times within a five-minute window. However, I quickly realized that this alert lacked the detail necessary for effective threat analysis.

To address this, I developed an enhanced custom rule. This improved alert incorporated specific usernames, such as "administrator," and grouped events by both source IP and username. I also increased the frequency of our checks, configuring the system to analyze data every minute while looking back over five minutes.

## Conclusion

Through this exercise, I gained several valuable insights:
- The importance of fine-tuning alerts to provide truly actionable information
- A deeper understanding of various authentication event IDs and their significance in Windows environments
- The value of correlating events across multiple data points for a more comprehensive picture
- The need for continuous refinement of alert systems to minimize false positives

As I move forward, our next session will focus on creating dashboards to visualize the sources of these authentication attempts, further enhancing my ability to detect and respond to threats efficiently.

#CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #MYDFIRChallenge #HandsOnExperience #Day16 16:Tc55,
## Day 14 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Creating an SSH Brute Force Alert and Dashboard

## Overview

Today, I focused on setting up real-time alerts and dashboards to monitor brute-force activity from unauthorized sources. This exercise taught me how to visualize, monitor, and respond to SSH brute-force attacks more efficiently.

## Querying SSH Logs

The first task involved querying logs from my SSH server, which had already been ingested into ElasticSearch. By accessing the Discover tab, I could filter out logs specific to my SSH server. I found it crucial to focus on specific fields like `system.auth.ssh.event` and `user.name` to track failed authentication attempts. The process began by filtering for failed SSH authentication attempts. This was accomplished by searching for logs where the `system.auth.ssh.event` field indicated failed attempts, giving me an initial view of how many attempts were occurring and from where.

## Building the Brute Force Alert

Next, I focused on creating an alert for SSH brute-force attempts. The goal was to automate the detection process and trigger an alert based on predefined thresholds. Using ElasticSearch's alert feature, I created a search-based threshold rule. My rule was set to trigger if more than five failed login attempts occurred within five minutes, a common indicator of brute-force activity.

I also configured how frequently the rule should check for new logs. To ensure near real-time monitoring, I set it to check every minute. While this was a basic alert configuration, it showcased the power of automating log analysis in detecting potential threats. Though this particular rule may not be perfect, it sets a solid foundation for building more sophisticated alerts later.

## Visualizing with Dashboards

To complement the alert system, I created a visual dashboard to track the geographical origins of these brute-force attempts. By navigating to the Maps section in ElasticSearch, I built a dashboard that plotted failed authentication attempts based on their source IP geolocation. This allowed me to see patterns of attack, such as which regions were targeting my SSH server the most.

For example, I noticed most failed attempts came from countries like North Korea and China. Using the choropleth layer in the map, I visualized these locations, providing an easy-to-understand view of attack origins.

## Conclusion

By the end of Day 14, I had successfully created both an alert system and a dashboard for monitoring SSH brute-force attacks. The combination of real-time alerts and visualization tools has significantly improved my ability to detect and respond to these types of attacks quickly.
