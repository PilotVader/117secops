## Day 25 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Integrating OS Ticket with Elastic Stack

## Overview

On Day 25 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I focused on integrating OS Ticket into my Elastic Stack environment. This integration allows for a more streamlined workflow, automatically creating tickets for alerts generated by Elastic. Here's how I approached it.

## Setting Up the API Key in OS Ticket

To start, I accessed the OS Ticket control panel and created a new API key. Since both my OS Ticket and Elastic Stack servers are hosted within the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), I used the private IP address of my Elastic Stack server for this configuration. If your servers are in different environments, you'd use the public IP instead.

Once I had the correct IP address, I configured the API key to allow ticket creation. With the key ready, I copied it into a notepad for easy reference during the Elastic setup.

## Configuring the Connector in Elastic Stack

Next, I moved to the Elastic Stack interface. From Stack Management, I navigated to the Connectors section. To enable the integration, I needed to activate Elastic's 30-day free trial, which allows the use of APIs. Once the trial was active, I created a new webhook connector, giving it a name like "OS Ticket."

The connector required:
- The OS Ticket server's IP address
- The API key I had generated earlier
- Necessary authentication headers

I added this information and then tested the connection. Initially, there was a network issue that required troubleshooting, but I later identified that the problem was with the private IP configuration on the OS Ticket server.

## Resolving Network Issues

Upon inspecting the OS Ticket server, I realized it was using a public IP rather than the private IP necessary for my setup. After correcting the network configuration and assigning the correct private IP address, the connection between Elastic Stack and OS Ticket was established successfully. A quick test confirmed that the integration was functioning as expected, with alerts now automatically generating tickets in OS Ticket.

## Conclusion

With OS Ticket fully integrated into my Elastic environment, I've added another layer of automation to my SOC setup. This integration will improve incident tracking and alert management, making the process more efficient. In the coming days, I'll shift focus to investigating alerts, beginning with SSH brute force detection.

#CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #MYDFIRChallenge #HandsOnExperience #Day25 14:Tbe9,
## Day 24 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Setting Up and Configuring OS Ticket

## Overview

On Day 24 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge! I'll dive into OS Ticket, a ticketing system that will be an essential tool for my SOC operations. The aim is to set up OS Ticket successfully and configure it on a Windows Server. This system will streamline ticket management for the alerts we'll deal with throughout the challenge. Let's get started!

## Deploying the Server

The first step in setting up OS Ticket is to deploy a server. I used Vulture for this process, selecting "Cloud Compute" with a shared CPU and Windows Server 2022. The server specifications don't need to be too powerful; I chose 1 CPU and 2 GB of memory. After selecting a location and setting up firewall configurations, the server was ready for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access.

## Setting Up the Web Server

Once connected to the server, I installed XAMPP, a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution. XAMPP makes it easy to set up Apache, MySQL, and PHP, all necessary for OS Ticket to function. After downloading XAMPP, I configured it by:

- Changing the Apache domain name to my server's public IP address
- Modifying the phpMyAdmin configuration to ensure secure access from my SOC analyst laptop

## Configuring Firewall Rules

Before moving further, I created inbound firewall rules for ports 80 and 443. This ensures that only authorized devices can access the web server. With XAMPP running, I started both the Apache and MySQL services and verified that everything was configured correctly.

## Installing OS Ticket

Next, I downloaded OS Ticket from their official site, choosing the latest stable version. After extracting the files, I moved them to the XAMPP htdocs folder to be served by the Apache server. Once the web server was up and running, I accessed the OS Ticket setup page, which prompted me to configure the system. This included:

- Renaming configuration files
- Setting up a MySQL database for OS Ticket to store data

## Finalizing the Installation

With the database created and the necessary configurations in place, the final step was to run the OS Ticket installation. After entering admin details and configuring the database connection, the OS Ticket was successfully installed. I also ensured file permissions were properly set for security.

## Conclusion

With this system, I'll be able to manage SOC alerts efficiently. Up next, I'll explore how to integrate OS Ticket with my tech stack so that alerts automatically generate tickets.

#CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #OSSTicket #MyDFIRChallenge #Day24 15:Tc12,
## Day 23 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Understanding and Implementing a Ticketing System

## Overview

On Day 23 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I explored the significance of tracking security alerts and how a ticketing system plays a crucial role. Tracking an alert in any security tool is vital for identifying misconfigurations, and potential attacks, or understanding how it was handled. This is where a ticketing system comes in.

## What Is a Ticketing System?

A ticketing system is a tool designed to create and manage tickets for various tasks or incidents. These tickets can represent anything from security alerts to troubleshooting requests or customer complaints. The goal of a ticketing system is to provide an organized method to track issues, offer an audit trail, and ensure accountability. In the context of cybersecurity, having a ticketing system satisfies one of the three As of security: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA).

Popular ticketing systems used in real-world environments include:
- Jira
- ServiceNow
- Freshdesk
- Zendesk

However, these are commercial products, and today, I'll introduce you to an open-source alternative that you can set up for free: OS Ticket.

## Introducing OS Ticket

OS Ticket, developed by Enhancesoft, is an open-source ticketing system that offers a wide range of features to fulfill core responsibilities found in commercial products. Some of the features include:

- Customizable fields
- Ticket filters for routing
- Assigning and transferring tickets
- Setting up a Service Level Agreement (SLA)

By integrating OS Ticket into your SOC workflow, you can begin mimicking the operations of a small SOC, gaining practical experience as you go.

You can choose to either self-host the OS Ticket (on-premise) or have the service managed for you, but the self-hosted option is completely free. While the free version only supports email integrations, this is sufficient for this challenge.

## Getting Started with OS Ticket

In the next step of this challenge, I will be going through setting up and configuring OS Ticket, allowing us to integrate it into our SOC analyst workflow. By doing so, I'll gain firsthand experience in:

- Tracking incidents
- Improving my skills in audit trails
- Understanding how ticketing systems contribute to security operations

## Conclusion

With OS Ticket, you now have a powerful tool to manage alerts, track tasks, and enhance the efficiency of your SOC environment. As we move forward, I will continue to explore how to leverage this system in practical scenarios.

## Day 30 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Conclusion

## Overview

As I complete the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, the journey has significantly deepened my understanding of SOC operations and cybersecurity best practices. Over these 30 days, I've worked with key tools, investigated real-world threats, and honed my incident response skills. Here's a recap of the most valuable lessons from this experience.

## Setting Up the Foundation: Elasticsearch, Kibana, and OS Ticket

The challenge began with setting up the core tools for a functional SOC environment: Elasticsearch and Kibana. These tools allowed me to collect, visualize, and analyze security data. I learned how to create dashboards that provided real-time insights into:
- Brute-force attacks
- Login attempts
- Suspicious RDP activity

Integrating OS Ticket into my environment was a significant milestone, as it automated incident management, ensuring every alert was systematically tracked and addressed.

## Advanced Detection and Response

As the challenge progressed, I encountered various real-world attack simulations. Investigating brute-force attacksâboth SSH and RDPâtaught me the importance of:
- Log analysis
- IP reputation checking
- Using tools like AbuseIPDB and GreyNoise

I gained hands-on experience in identifying and responding to malicious activity. Automating ticket creation for brute-force alerts streamlined the incident-handling process, reinforcing how crucial automation is in a fast-paced SOC environment.

## Command and Control (C2) Detection

A key highlight of the challenge was investigating the Mythic C2 framework, which provided insight into how attackers use Command and Control (C2) agents to maintain access to compromised systems. I utilized:
- Network telemetry
- Tools like RITA to identify beaconing behavior
- Process creation logs

This experience demonstrated the importance of understanding network traffic and process creation logs in detecting persistent threats.

## Endpoint Security with Elastic Defend

One of the most critical components of the challenge was deploying Elastic Defend for endpoint detection and response (EDR). By testing:
- Malware detection
- Host isolation
- Telemetry data analysis

I experienced firsthand how EDR solutions play a vital role in securing endpoints. I explored Elastic's telemetry data to investigate threats more deeply and learned how to prevent and mitigate attacks by quarantining malicious files and isolating compromised hosts.
