## Day 26 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Investigating an SSH Brute Force Alert

## Overview

On Day 26 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I focused on investigating an SSH Brute Force alert, which is a common attack that tries to gain unauthorized access to a server by repeatedly guessing login credentials. This was a great opportunity to apply some detection tools I've set up throughout this challenge.

## Investigating the SSH Brute Force Alert

The first step in my investigation was to navigate to the "Alerts" section in Kibana under the security tab. I had several alerts, so I selected the most recent one, which occurred on September 17th. This alert flagged multiple failed login attempts to the root account from a specific IP address. The next step was to investigate the context behind this alert and understand whether this was a serious threat or just background noise.

## Checking the IP Address Reputation

To determine if the IP address in question was known for malicious activity, I used AbuseIPDB, a reliable source for checking the reputation of IP addresses. Sure enough, the IP had been flagged for abusive behavior over 2000 times, and the reports highlighted failed password attempts, indicating brute-force activity. I also turned to GreyNoise, which further confirmed that the IP was malicious, labeling it as an SSH brute-forcer and showing associated tags for malicious behavior. This gave me enough confidence to mark the IP as a known attacker.

## Analyzing Affected Users

Next, I needed to understand if the IP had targeted other users. I ran a query in Kibana to see the scope of the attack over the past 30 days. The results showed that the IP had attempted to brute force multiple users, including:
- Root account
- Oracle account
- Guest account
- Test accounts

Knowing which accounts were targeted helped me gauge the scale of the attack.

## Checking for Successful Logins

A critical step in the investigation was checking if any of the brute-force attempts had been successful. I searched the logs for successful login attempts but found none. This was a relief because, if successful, the attacker could have caused significant damage by executing commands or downloading malicious scripts.

## Conclusion

With no successful login attempts and the IP flagged as malicious, I felt confident in closing the alert. In a real-world environment, I would document all my findings in the ticketing system and follow up with any necessary changes to ensure similar alerts are handled promptly. This investigation helped reinforce my understanding of SSH brute-force attacks and the importance of monitoring for suspicious activity.

## Day 27 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Investigating an RDP Brute Force Attack

## Overview

On Day 27 of my 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I shifted focus to investigating an RDP brute force attack alert. The process follows a similar methodology to investigating an SSH brute force attack, with the only major difference being the protocol in question. Here's how I broke it down.

## Reviewing the Alert

I started by navigating to the alerts section in my web interface, filtering for RDP brute force alerts. Out of 327 total alerts, I found 5 related to RDP brute force. I selected one of the alerts and also took note of the source IP, which had a username attempt of "administrator." There were 5 events in total, so I dug deeper into the details.

## Automating Ticket Creation in OS Ticket

Because I had already set up an automated ticket creation system for SSH brute force alerts, I decided to replicate the process for this RDP alert. Using the existing SSH rule, I copied the webhook details and applied them to the RDP brute force rule. This allowed me to automatically generate a ticket within OS Ticket whenever an RDP brute force attack is detected.

## Investigating the IP Address

For the next steps, I wanted to gather more information about the attacking IP address. First, I used AbuseIPDB, which revealed that the IP had been reported 71 times, with a 63% confidence score of malicious activity, mostly relating to RDP brute force attempts. Then, I checked GreyNoise, which classified the IP as "unknown intent," meaning it was engaged in internet-wide scanning but not specifically targeting my environment. This data gave me enough confidence to mark the IP as associated with RDP brute force activity.

## Analyzing for Affected Users

I next wanted to see if any other users were targeted by the attacker. After filtering my logs for the past 30 days, I found 271 events related to this IP, but all of them were focused on the "administrator" account. This confirmed that no other user accounts had been affected.

## Checking for Successful Logins

A crucial part of any brute force investigation is determining whether the attacker was successful. In this case, I looked for Windows event code 4624, which indicates a successful login. Fortunately, there were no successful authentication attempts from this IP address, so I could confirm that the attack had failed.

## Conclusion

Even though there were no successful logins in this case, the investigation served as a good reminder of the importance of thorough log review and automated alerting. In the next step of this challenge, I'll be diving deeper into another investigation, this time analyzing activity from the Mythic C2 agent. Stay tuned for more insights!

## Day 28 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Investigating the Mythic C2 Framework

## Overview

On Day 28 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I shifted my focus to the Mythic Command and Control (C2) framework. Attackers widely use this framework to maintain control over compromised systems, allowing them to execute commands, steal data, and conduct other malicious activities without detection. My task was to investigate how the Mythic agent svchost_pilotvader.exe operated and how its communication could be detected.

## Tracing the Mythic C2 Agent

My investigation's first step was locating the Mythic C2 agent on one of the compromised systems. Armed with the knowledge of the agent's name, I used the Kibana Discover tool to search through the logs, narrowing the time range to the past 30 days. This allowed me to pinpoint 25 distinct events associated with the agent. Sorting these events chronologically, I was able to reconstruct the timeline of the agent's activity, gaining critical insight into how it interacted with the system over time.

## Identifying C2 Traffic Through Network Telemetry

In cases where the agent's name isn't known, identifying suspicious traffic can be challenging. Network telemetry analysis plays a critical role in detecting C2 activity. I began by analyzing network logs to identify the "top talkers"âthe machines that generated the most traffic. Since Mythic, like most C2 frameworks, relies on consistent communication between the infected host and the attacker's server, unusual traffic patterns often stand out.

To refine my detection, I utilized RITA (Real Intelligence Threat Analytics), a tool designed to detect beaconing behavior in C2 traffic. Beaconing occurs when an infected machine regularly checks in with a C2 server, and identifying these intervals allowed me to isolate Mythic's communication patterns. The detection of this regular network activity provided strong evidence of the C2 framework's presence.

## Investigating Process Creation Logs

Beyond network traffic, process creation analysis was essential for tracing the agent's activity. By examining these logs, I could see the exact processes initiated by the Mythic agent and track the attacker's movement within the system. These logs offer a detailed view of how the agent behaves, from its initial execution to spawning other processes critical to maintaining control over the system.

## Conclusion

Day 28's deep dive into the Mythic C2 framework offered valuable lessons in tracking adversary behavior. By leveraging network telemetry, beaconing detection, and process creation logs, I was able to uncover the activities of the Mythic agent and better understand its communication patterns. As the challenge nears its end, these investigations continue to hone my skills in threat detection and incident response.

#CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #MYDFIRChallenge #HandsOnExperience #Day28 16:Tce2,
## Day 21 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Brute Force Attack & Establishing a C2 Session

## Overview

Today, I focused on executing a brute force attack, generating a Mythic agent, and establishing a Command and Control (C2) session on a Windows Server.

## Brute Force Attack on Windows Server

I started by connecting to the target Windows server via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). For this, I intentionally set a weak password on the server: Winter2024! This allowed me to simulate a typical scenario where an attacker might exploit weak credentials.

Next, I used the Crowbar tool on my Parrot OS machine to brute-force the RDP login. With the weak password added to a wordlist, I ran Crowbar, which quickly cracked the credentials. Using the recovered password, I accessed the server via xfreerdp, verifying the successful login by executing basic commands like Whoami and ipconfig.

## Disabling Windows Defender for Defense Evasion

Once inside the Windows server, my first task was to disable its defenses. I navigated to the Windows Security settings and manually turned off real-time protection along with other key security features.

## Generating the Mythic Agent

With the server exposed, I generated a Mythic C2 payload. Mythic is a popular Command and Control (C2) framework used by attackers to remotely control compromised systems. I installed the Apollo agent and the HTTP C2 Profile on my Mythic platform, customizing the settings to ensure the payload would effectively communicate back to my control server.

After setting up the Mythic agent, I created a Windows executable payload. This payload would be used to establish a persistent connection between the compromised server and the Mythic C2 server.

## Establishing the C2 Session

To deliver the payload to the Windows server, I used Python's http.server on port 9999 and PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest to download it onto the target machine. Once the payload was executed on the server, it successfully connected to the Mythic C2 platform.

## Data Exfiltration

With full control established, I moved on to exfiltrate data. Specifically, I retrieved a file named passwords.txt from the server's Documents folder. Using the download command in Mythic, I successfully downloaded the file, confirming the presence of the weak password, Winter2024!

## Conclusion

I simulated a brute force attack, compromised a Windows server, and used Mythic to establish a C2 session for remote control and data exfiltration. This activity demonstrates the methods attackers use to infiltrate systems and the importance of maintaining strong security practices, such as enforcing complex passwords and securing endpoints.

Next, I'll focus on creating alerts and dashboards to detect Mythic activity and defend against similar attacks. Stay tuned!
