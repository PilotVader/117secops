## Day 19 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Creating an Attack Diagram

## Overview

The focus for today is on using Draw.io, mapping out a plan to compromise a target machine, focusing on brute-forcing RDP credentials, disabling Windows Defender, and establishing a C2 connection.

## Building the Attack Diagram

The essential components of our attack:

- **Mythic C2 Server** – This is the command and control server that we'll use to manage our attack.
- **Windows Server** – This will be our target machine.
- **Attacker Laptop** – Running Kali Linux, this is the machine we'll be using for the attack.

A cloud represents the internet and connects all the components accordingly. The Kali Linux laptop will be on a separate network, while the Mythic C2 server will run in the cloud.

## Phase 1: Initial Access – Brute Force

In this phase, the attacker's laptop will attempt a brute force attack over Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain access to the Windows Server. This will serve as the initial access point. If successful, we will authenticate and proceed to the next phase.

## Phase 2: Discovery – Gathering Information

Once inside the Windows Server, the next step is Discovery. The attacker will run a series of commands like:

- whoami
- ipconfig
- net user
- net group

These commands help us learn about the system, its users, and network settings. This information is crucial for planning our next moves.

## Phase 3: Defense Evasion – Disabling Defender

Before executing any malicious payloads, we need to bypass Windows Defender. The focus of this phase is defense evasion. Using our elevated privileges, we will attempt to disable Windows Defender on the server to prevent it from detecting our actions.

## Phase 4: Execution – Downloading and Running Mythic Agent

Once the defenses are down, we move to execution. In this phase, the Windows Server will reach out to our Mythic C2 server to download an agent. This will be done using PowerShell's Invoke-Expression (IEX) command to fetch and run the agent.

## Phase 5: Command and Control – Establishing C2

With the Mythic agent successfully installed, we establish a C2 connection between the compromised Windows Server and the Mythic C2 server. At this point, the attacker has full control over the target machine, enabling further malicious actions.

## Phase 6: Exfiltration – Stealing Data

The final phase is exfiltration. Creating a fake password file called passwords.txt on the Windows Server. Using the established C2 session, we'll download this file from the compromised server, mimicking a data theft scenario.

## Conclusion

This attack diagram is a simplified blueprint of how to compromise a machine, which is strictly for educational purposes only. Next, we'll go over how to set up the Mythic server and begin executing these steps. Stay tuned!

#CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #MYDFIRChallenge #HandsOnExperience #Day19 14:Tb3a,
## Day 22 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Creating Alerts and Dashboards for Mythic C2 Detection

## Overview

On Day 22 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I focused on creating alerts and dashboards to detect Mythic C2 activity, building on the groundwork from Day 21. This step is crucial in setting up efficient monitoring and detection of suspicious activity within the SOC environment.

## Creating the Alert

I started by accessing the Elastic web UI, navigating to the Discover section, and resetting the view. To ensure I captured relevant events, I set the time range to 30 days. This gave me a clear view of the events linked to "svchost-pilotvader.exe," which was triggered by our Mythic C2 agent in the previous exercise.

The next step was filtering the process creation events using Sysmon's event code 1. This allowed me to see details like the MD5 hash of the binary associated with Mythic C2. Using this information, I further investigated the event by cross-referencing the SHA-1 hash with VirusTotal for additional context. Since the agent was newly created, the results were limited but still useful.

Interestingly, the original file name of the Mythic C2 agent was "apollo.exe," even though it was executed as "svchost-pilotvader.exe." This discrepancy helped pinpoint the activity more accurately, making it a prime candidate for alert creation.

## Setting the Alert

I created a query based on event code 1 for process creation. The query focused on the SHA-256 hash and the original file name "apollo.exe." Once the alert was set, it was designed to trigger whenever Mythic C2 activity surfaced in the environment.

## Building the Dashboard

Next, I built a dashboard to visualize the Mythic C2 activity. By leveraging Elastic's Kibana features, I set up visualizations that track key metrics, such as:

- Process creation events
- File hashes
- Network connections linked to Mythic C2

The dashboard provides real-time insights, allowing for faster detection and response to similar threats in the future.

## Conclusion

With the alert and dashboard in place, I've taken an important step toward proactive monitoring of Mythic C2 activity. These tools will enhance the detection and visibility of malicious actions within the environment. Next, I'll refine my detection capabilities by expanding these alerts and dashboards to cover more complex threats.

#CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #MYDFIRChallenge #HandsOnExperience #Day22 15:Tce4,
## Day 18 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Understanding Command and Control (C2)

## Overview

Welcome to Day 18 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge. Today, our focus would be on an essential part of cyberattacks, Command and Control (C2). In this blog, we'll go over what C2 is, why it's crucial for attackers, and the common tools they use. We'll also look at one particular framework, Mythic, which we will use later in this challenge.

## What is Command and Control?

Command and Control (C2) refers to the techniques attackers use to communicate with systems they have compromised in a victim's network. According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, C2 allows attackers to maintain control over the compromised system, enabling them to perform various malicious activities.

Once attackers gain access to a victim's machine, they need a way to interact with it remotely. C2 helps them move closer to their end goal, stealing credentials, exfiltrating data, or deploying ransomware.

## Why is Establishing C2 Important?

The importance of C2 for attackers cannot be overstated. Without it, they couldn't perform further actions on the compromised network. C2 is a gateway for attackers to escalate privileges, move laterally, steal sensitive information, or even disrupt services.

For attackers to cause harm, they must maintain access to the network, which they do through C2 channels. The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists 18 different techniques attackers use to establish C2, and understanding these techniques is crucial for any SOC analyst.

## Common Tools and Frameworks for C2

Several C2 frameworks are used in the wild. Let's focus on four of the most common:

### 1. Metasploit
Metasploit is a popular framework used for vulnerability exploitation. It's widely available and often used in ethical hacking environments, but attackers also use it to exploit vulnerable systems.

### 2. Cobalt Strike
Cobalt Strike is a commercial adversary emulation tool. Though it's legitimate software, attackers frequently use it in real-world breaches. Fortunately, because it's so widely used, there are many detection methods available.

### 3. Sliver
Sliver is an open-source alternative to Cobalt Strike, developed by Bishop Fox. It supports multiple protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS, making it a versatile tool for attackers.

### 4. Mythic
Mythic is the framework I'll be using in this challenge. Built with GoLang and Docker, Mythic provides a user-friendly interface for managing payloads and C2 profiles. This flexibility makes it a favorite for adversary emulation.

## Conclusion

In the next part of the challenge, I'll dive deeper into crafting attacks on our Windows Server and setting up a Mythic C2 server. Stay tuned as we explore how to deploy agents and establish a successful C2 session.

## Day 30 of the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Conclusion

## Overview

As I complete the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, the journey has significantly deepened my understanding of SOC operations and cybersecurity best practices. Over these 30 days, I've worked with key tools, investigated real-world threats, and honed my incident response skills. Here's a recap of the most valuable lessons from this experience.

## Setting Up the Foundation: Elasticsearch, Kibana, and OS Ticket

The challenge began with setting up the core tools for a functional SOC environment: Elasticsearch and Kibana. These tools allowed me to collect, visualize, and analyze security data. I learned how to create dashboards that provided real-time insights into:
- Brute-force attacks
- Login attempts
- Suspicious RDP activity

Integrating OS Ticket into my environment was a significant milestone, as it automated incident management, ensuring every alert was systematically tracked and addressed.

## Advanced Detection and Response

As the challenge progressed, I encountered various real-world attack simulations. Investigating brute-force attacks—both SSH and RDP—taught me the importance of:
- Log analysis
- IP reputation checking
- Using tools like AbuseIPDB and GreyNoise

I gained hands-on experience in identifying and responding to malicious activity. Automating ticket creation for brute-force alerts streamlined the incident-handling process, reinforcing how crucial automation is in a fast-paced SOC environment.

## Command and Control (C2) Detection

A key highlight of the challenge was investigating the Mythic C2 framework, which provided insight into how attackers use Command and Control (C2) agents to maintain access to compromised systems. I utilized:
- Network telemetry
- Tools like RITA to identify beaconing behavior
- Process creation logs

This experience demonstrated the importance of understanding network traffic and process creation logs in detecting persistent threats.

## Endpoint Security with Elastic Defend

One of the most critical components of the challenge was deploying Elastic Defend for endpoint detection and response (EDR). By testing:
- Malware detection
- Host isolation
- Telemetry data analysis

I experienced firsthand how EDR solutions play a vital role in securing endpoints. I explored Elastic's telemetry data to investigate threats more deeply and learned how to prevent and mitigate attacks by quarantining malicious files and isolating compromised hosts.

## Looking Ahead

A big thank you to [@MyDFIR](https://www.youtube.com/@MyDFIR) for creating this challenge. It provided invaluable hands-on experience, deepened my technical skills, and gave me valuable insights into the day-to-day work of a SOC analyst. The challenge has equipped me with practical skills in:
- Threat detection
- Incident response
- Endpoint security

This journey has reinforced my passion for cybersecurity, and I'm eager to continue growing as a SOC analyst.
