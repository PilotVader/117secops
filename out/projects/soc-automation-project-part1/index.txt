# Part 2: Infrastructure Setup

My focus has shifted to establishing the core infrastructure and generating telemetry data for analysis, a critical foundation for any Security Operations Center (SOC). This phase involves setting up essential components including a Windows client, Wazuh server, and TheHive for comprehensive security monitoring and incident response.

## Setting Up the Windows Environment

I began the infrastructure deployment with a Windows 10 virtual machine, ensuring I had a proper endpoint for monitoring. Using VirtualBox to create the VM, I allocated appropriate resources and installed Windows 10 with the necessary configurations to support my security tools.

Sysmon, a critical component for endpoint monitoring, was installed using PowerShell with administrative privileges. This installation required careful attention to the placement of the configuration file and proper execution of the installation commands on Windows PowerShell. After installation, I verified Sysmon's presence through the Services console and Event Viewer, confirming it was actively monitoring system events.

## Deploying Wazuh Server

With the endpoint ready, I moved to setting up the Wazuh server, my primary security monitoring platform. On the same VirtualBox, I deployed the Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine. I also configured VirtualBox's network settings and set it to a bridged adapter to allow communication with my endpoint (Windows 10 OS).

The Wazuh installation process involved running their official installation script, which automatically configured the basic components. These included the indexer, server, and dashboard components, which form the core of Wazuh's security monitoring capabilities. The installation provided secure credentials for accessing the dashboard, which I carefully documented for future use.

Wazuh serves as the log manager and intrusion detection system. The setup begins by accessing the Wazuh dashboard and retrieving the necessary credentials for configuration. To integrate a Windows client, the agent configuration command is generated from the Wazuh dashboard, tailored to the server's IP. This command is then executed on the Windows machine, establishing a connection with the Wazuh server. Although this method didn't work for me after so many trials, I eventually had to use another method where I had to generate a key through the Wazuh agent manager on my Ubuntu terminal by running `/var/ossec/bin/manage_agents`. I then used the agent manager desktop interface on my Windows 10 to register the windows as an endpoint using the key generated. The client's status was then monitored and was active, and I could confirm telemetry was being successfully transmitted.

## Configuring TheHive with Cassandra

TheHive's efficiency depends heavily on its backend database, Cassandra. The configuration starts with modifying the Cassandra settings to align with the lab setup. This includes navigating to the configuration file and updating parameters like the cluster name and listen address to ensure proper connectivity. Restarting the Cassandra service and confirming its active status are crucial steps to ensure everything runs smoothly.

To integrate theHive with Cassandra, adjustments to the application settings file are required. This involves specifying the cluster name and database connection details. To avoid operational issues, it is vital to ensure that TheHive has the correct permissions to access necessary directories. Once configured, TheHive services are started, and the application becomes accessible through its designated URL.

For this section, I used a separate machine running Parrot operating system.

## Establishing Connectivity

After configuring all components, and confirming my endpoint status on my Wazuh dashboard as "Active", I focused on establishing proper connectivity between systems. The Windows agent was deployed to my Wazuh server, creating a secure communication channel for transmitting security events. Wazuh's role in the lab setup revolves around monitoring and alert generation. By installing Wazuh and connecting it to TheHive, alerts become actionable incidents for investigation. This is what I'll explore in further episodes of this post.

I decided to test telemetry ingestion on my Wazuh server by creating a file document on my endpoint to see if I could see any alert related to the action, and it was a success.

## Conclusion

Through these exercises, I've established a robust foundation for security monitoring and incident response. In the next chapter of this series, I will be going more in-depth with telemetry generation using Mimikatz, which is a powerful tool used for extracting credentials from Windows systems, I will learn how to send telemetry containing mimikatz, configure Wazuh to log all telemetry and craft custom rule to detect mimikatz usage. In further chapter, I will also explore the use of TheHive which I've just set up in the chapter.

Stay tuned.

# Part 3: Generating and Ingesting Telemetry

## Introduction

In this third part of the MYDFIR SOC Automation Project home lab series, I dive into the critical process of generating telemetry from a Windows 10 machine and ensuring it is correctly ingested into Wazuh. By the end of this session, I would have successfully configured my system to log events, including activity from Mimikatz, and triggered a custom alert. This hands-on process not only enhances my understanding of SIEM operations but also strengthens my ability to detect and analyze security incidents effectively.

## Configuring Wazuh to Ingest Sysmon Logs

To begin, I access the Wazuh configuration settings on my Windows 10 machine. When Wazuh is installed, its configuration files are located under Program Files (x86), specifically within the ek-agent folder. The key file I need to modify is ossec.conf. This file governs how logs are processed and which events are included or excluded from analysis. By default, certain event IDs are excluded using the != operator. However, for my purpose, I need to monitor processes related to Mimikatz, which requires Sysmon to be installed or Windows Security Event ID 4688 to be enabled. Since Sysmon was installed in part two of this series, I opt for that method.

Before making changes, I first create a backup of ossec.conf to safeguard against errors. This allows me to revert back if needed. I then modify the configuration to ingest Sysmon logs by adding a new entry under the localfile section. To locate the correct Sysmon channel name, I open the Windows Event Viewer, navigate to Applications and Services > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon, and retrieve the operational log name from the properties section. This name is then inserted into my ossec.conf file in place of the existing application log configuration.

## Adjusting Log Categories and Restarting Services

Next, I remove other log categories such as Application, Security, and System, ensuring that only Sysmon logs are forwarded to the Wazuh manager. Once the changes are saved, administrative privileges are required to replace the existing configuration file. After this, I restart the Wazuh service, as any configuration changes must be followed by a service restart to take effect.

## Testing Telemetry with Mimikatz

With the updated configuration in place, I verify the ingestion of Sysmon logs in the Wazuh dashboard. Searching for "Sysmon" in the Alerts index may take some time before logs appear. To test this setup, I download and execute Mimikatz. Since Windows Defender would block this file, I must first exclude the Downloads folder from virus scanning. This is done through Windows Security settings by adding an exclusion for the Downloads directory. Also, Google Chrome may prevent the download, so I disable Safe Browsing under Privacy and Security settings in Chrome before proceeding.

Once Mimikatz is downloaded and extracted, I run it via an administrative PowerShell session and monitor Wazuh for related alerts. If no alerts appear, it is likely because Wazuh only logs events when a predefined rule is triggered. To address this, I modify the ossec.conf file on the Wazuh manager to log all events by default. This is done by enabling the logall and logall_json options in the configuration file. After saving these changes, I restart the Wazuh manager service.

## Enhancing Log Archiving and Indexing

To ensure that all logs are archived and ingested into Wazuh, I also update Filebeat's configuration. This involves navigating to the Filebeat YAML configuration file and changing the archives_enabled setting from false to true. As always, after modifying configurations, I restart the Filebeat service to apply the changes.

Once the configurations are updated, I proceed to create a new index in the Wazuh dashboard for archived logs. This is done through the Stack Management section, where I define a new index pattern named wazuh-archives-*. After setting the timestamp field, I finalize the index creation. Now, when navigating to the Discover section of Wazuh, I can select my newly created index and search for logs related to Mimikatz.

## Troubleshooting Log Ingestion Issues

If events are still not visible, I perform troubleshooting by inspecting the archived log files in the Wazuh manager's CLI. By navigating to /var/ossec/logs/archives/, I list the available log files and use cat and grep commands to search for Mimikatz activity. If the logs are present in the archive but not appearing in the dashboard, it indicates a delay in ingestion, which resolves over time.

## Conclusion

This session underscores the importance of proper log configuration and SIEM tuning. By ensuring that all relevant events are captured and making necessary adjustments, I enhance my detection capabilities. With my telemetry now successfully feeding into Wazuh, I am well-prepared for the final part of the series, where I will further refine my detection rules and automation workflows.

Stay Tuned.

#CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #MYDFIR #HandsOnExperience #SecurityMonitoring #IncidentResponse 15:Tbce,
# Part 1: Planning the Infrastructure

As I continue my journey into cybersecurity, I've embarked on a SOC Automation Project aimed at building a home lab environment from scratch. The ultimate goal is to create a fully functional Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) setup, with tools like Wazuh, The Hive, and Shuffle for case management and automation. This project will enable hands-on experience critical for Security Operations Center (SOC) tasks, providing a foundation for alert management, response actions, and data enrichment.

## Diagramming the Lab Environment

This week, I began by visualizing the lab's architecture, which will guide deploying various SOC components. Using Draw.io, I created a logical flow diagram, depicting the interaction of key elements like a Windows 10 client with Wazuh and SOAR tools (The Hive and Shuffle) across different network layers. This visual roadmap is crucial, as many cybersecurity interviews require candidates to whiteboard a secure lab setup—a skill that this project will reinforce.

## The main workflow consists of:

1. **Event Generation**: The Windows 10 client will send event logs to Wazuh, acting as the lab's SIEM system. This data flow simulates the information-sharing pipeline from the endpoint to SIEM.
2. **Alert Triggering and Enrichment**: Wazuh will analyze these events and generate alerts, which are then forwarded to Shuffle for enrichment with open-source intelligence (OSINT).
3. **Case Management**: Finally, the enriched data and actionable alerts will be logged in The Hive, streamlining incident tracking and case management.

## Connecting the Dots

To logically map how alerts will flow, color-coded connections will be implemented in the diagram to track data from generation, through analysis, to final case management. For example, alerts from Wazuh to Shuffle are labeled in blue, indicating a "send alert" action, while OSINT data flows in green to enrich the incident context. These connections provide a cohesive view of how data travels within the SOC environment, aligning the diagram to real-world incident workflows.

## Future Plans

In my upcoming posts, I'll move into deploying these tools on virtual machines, configuring Wazuh and The Hive, and connecting them with my local workstation. This setup will allow me to simulate common security alerts, test case management processes, and refine my incident response workflows.

Stay tuned as I document each stage, including implementation challenges, configurations, and SOC analysis techniques.

#MYDFIR #CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #HomeLab #Automation #HandsOnExperience
\`16:T18c2,
# Introduction

Having already gained hands-on experience through my personal cybersecurity projects and previous professional engagements, I am always looking for opportunities to broaden my exposure to enterprise-grade tools and real-world SOC environments. Over the past few months, I have worked extensively on my home lab, documented multiple projects, and sharpened my skills across areas such as SIEM, incident response, and vulnerability management. However, I wanted to push further, especially into the Microsoft security ecosystem, while also gaining structured exposure to premium enterprise tools.

That is why I enrolled in the Cyber Range internship program. This platform is built around Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Sentinel, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, combined with Tenable for enterprise vulnerability management. It provides a collaborative SOC-like environment where hundreds of analysts work within shared infrastructure that is constantly being targeted by real-world malicious activity. For me, this is not just about learning the basics, it is about refining my skills, testing myself in a live environment, and building familiarity with tools that are at the core of modern enterprise security operations.

## Getting Started and Building the Foundation

The first step in this journey is orientation. The Cyber Range platform begins with a structured roadmap that sets expectations for consistency and growth. Every participant is encouraged to treat it like a real job environment, logging in daily, building habits, and steadily improving. I will begin by following this roadmap, which introduces both theory and practice.

In these early weeks, I will revisit fundamental cybersecurity concepts, particularly those aligned with frameworks and compliance regulations. For example, I'll explore how frameworks like NIST or ISO provide the backbone for security controls, and how compliance drivers such as HIPAA or GDPR influence day-to-day security operations. These sessions will serve as a refresher and prepare me for the more technical modules that follow, while also sharpening my understanding of how policy connects to practice.

## Vulnerability Management with Tenable

The first major technical module focuses on vulnerability management, an essential discipline in any cybersecurity program. Using Tenable, I will learn how to scan systems for weaknesses, interpret the findings, and take steps toward remediation.

This will involve setting up and running vulnerability scans on virtual machines inside the shared Azure environment, examining the results, and applying patches or configuration changes to reduce risk. For example, if a scan reveals outdated services or missing patches, I'll work through the remediation process just as I would in a real enterprise. Over the coming weeks, my goal is to treat this module not as a checklist, but as a chance to build a workflow: from detection to prioritization, to resolution, and finally verification. Documenting these workflows will be an important part of this project.

## Threat Hunting, Security Operations, and Incident Response

The second technical phase immerses me in the SOC workflow. Here, I will be working with Microsoft Sentinel as the SIEM platform, Defender for Endpoint as the EDR solution, and real log data generated by hundreds of users and systems in the Cyber Range.

This is where theory meets practice. Over the next few weeks, I will analyze log flows, craft queries, investigate anomalies, and conduct basic threat hunting. Since the environment is live and exposed to the internet, there will be real attempts by malicious actors to probe and exploit systems. My task will be to detect these attempts, understand their tactics, and respond effectively.

I will also practice structured incident response. For example, if suspicious activity is detected on a virtual machine, I'll follow response steps: confirming the event, containing the activity, investigating root cause, and documenting lessons learned. This experience mirrors the responsibilities of a SOC analyst and will be central to my learning and documentation.

## From Learning to Internship Experience

Beyond the technical labs, the Cyber Range includes a formal internship component. As I progress, I will take on specific tasks that count toward this internship, such as vulnerability scans, incident investigations, and security monitoring activities. Each completed task adds to my record of experience, which can be verified by employers.

This part of the program is significant because it transforms the learning journey into something that can be added to a CV and LinkedIn profile as real internship experience. Over the next few weeks, I will treat these tasks as milestones, carefully documenting what I did, how I approached the problem, and what the outcomes were. This will not only strengthen my portfolio but also demonstrate a clear path of professional growth.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Project 5 marks an exciting phase in my cybersecurity journey. Unlike previous projects that focused on building my personal lab, this one places me directly inside a live, collaborative SOC-like environment where the stakes feel real and the tools mirror what enterprises use daily.

Over the next few weeks, I will document every stage of this process: from foundational refreshers to vulnerability management, from SOC threat hunting to structured incident response, even blogging about theoretical concepts I learn from the platform and finally the internship validation itself. Each update will be posted on this site, showcasing not just the technical steps but also the reflections, challenges, and lessons learned along the way.

The ultimate goal is to come out of this experience with practical, verifiable internship experience, sharpened SOC skills, and a portfolio that speaks directly to the expectations of employers. By treating this journey seriously and documenting it transparently, I hope to bridge the gap between learning and professional practice, one step at a time.
