# Day 3 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Setting up Elastic Search

## Overview

The focus for today was on setting up my own Elastic Search instance, following practical steps to build a foundational environment for security analysis.

## Cloud Environment Setup

First, I signed up on Vultr, a cloud service provider, which was used to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. To avoid connectivity issues, I ensured that all resources, including virtual machines (VMs), were in the same location as my VPC. For instance, I created the VPC in Manchester, so I deployed my VM in the same region.

After configuring my VPC, I deployed a server on Vultr with Ubuntu as the operating system. The server had 4 virtual CPUs and 16 GB of RAM to run Elastic Search. I opted out of unnecessary features like auto-backups and IPv6, keeping the setup streamlined, I then associated the VM with my VPC network to ensure it could communicate internally.

## Elastic Search Installation

Next, I accessed the server via SSH, using PowerShell to connect to my VM through its public IP address. Inside the VM, I updated the repositories and installed Elastic Search. During the installation, I was provided with critical security information, including a password for the built-in superuser account. I stored this information securely for future reference.

## Security Configuration

One essential step was configuring Elastic Search to be accessible beyond the local host. By modifying the network settings in the elasticsearch.yml configuration file, I allowed remote access from my SOC analyst laptop, making sure it was securely configured.

To tighten security, I created a firewall group in Vultr, limiting access to only trusted IP addresses, in this case, I gave access to my IP alone. This ensured that only authorized connections could reach the Elastic Search instance.

## Final Steps

Finally, I started the Elastic Search service and confirmed it was running smoothly. This marked the completion of setting up the Elastic Search instance, laying the groundwork for the next stepâconfiguring Kibana, the visualization tool for Elastic Search.

#CyberSecurity #SOCAnalyst #MYDFIRChallenge #HandsOnExperience #Day3 14:Tc76,
## Day 5 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Deploying Windows Server in the Cloud.

Day 5 of the challenge focused on deploying a Windows Server instance in the cloud, with a particular emphasis on network security and architecture decisions. This setup would serve as a target machine for generating security logs and analyzing potential threats.

## Initial Setup and Network Architecture

I began by logging into my Vultr account and preparing to set up a new Windows Server instance. The first crucial decision involved determining whether to include this server in our previously configured Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Our instructor provided valuable insights into network architecture, highlighting the importance of network segmentation and security.

## Security Considerations

The core concept we explored was network isolation and its role in security. By keeping the Windows Server separate from the VPC, we could better protect our internal network from potential threats. This isolation is particularly crucial because internet exposure increases the server's risk profile, and separation prevents lateral movement in case of compromise. It effectively reduces the overall attack surface and provides better damage control in case of a breach.

## Deployment Configuration

With these security considerations in mind, I proceeded with the deployment. I deployed the server outside the VPC, configuring it without private IP address space connection. The server was set up with public IP access only, and I accessed it through Vultr's console. This configuration aligned with our security-first approach to the deployment.

## Remote Access Setup

The next critical step was configuring Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access. I exposed RDP to the internet for remote management, fully acknowledging the increased attack surface this would create. This setup was intentional, as it would allow the server to generate security logs from various access attempts. After configuration, I verified that RDP functionality was working as expected.

## Next Steps

The server is now operational and will begin accumulating logs from various access attempts. These logs will be crucial for analyzing unauthorized access attempts, identifying potential threats, and developing security monitoring strategies. This data will form the foundation for our future analysis exercises.

## Conclusion

This day's work established a crucial component of our security lab - a Windows Server instance that will generate real-world security logs. The careful consideration of network architecture and security implications provided valuable insights into enterprise security practices. In the next session, I'll be configuring a Fleet Server to enhance our lab's endpoint management capabilities.

# Day 4 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Setting Up Kibana

## Overview

Today's focus was on setting up Kibana, a powerful data visualization tool. So I started by downloading Kibana from Elastic's website and installing it on my server. Once installed, I dove into configuring Kibana to ensure it was accessible from any device, not just the local host. This required updating the kibana.yml configuration file and replacing the default localhost setting with my server's public IP.

## Service Configuration

After configuration, I needed to ensure Kibana would start automatically whenever my server rebooted. This involved enabling and starting the Kibana service. Once everything was running, I verified the service status to confirm that it was active.

## Secure Connection to Elasticsearch

Next, I generated an Elasticsearch enrollment token, a crucial step for securely connecting Kibana to Elasticsearch. This token was stored safely for later use.

## Troubleshooting Access

While attempting to access Kibana through my browser, I encountered a connection timeout error. This led me to adjust my firewall settings both on Vultr, my cloud provider and on the Ubuntu server itself. Once these adjustments were made, I successfully accessed the Kibana web interface.

## Security Settings and Final Steps

Inside Kibana, I proceeded to configure security settings, adding encryption keys for saved objects to ensure data integrity and security. With everything set up and running smoothly, Kibana was fully operational, marking a successful completion of Day 4.

## Conclusion

This day was essential in setting up the foundation for future data analysis. Kibana is the gateway to visualizing and interacting with data stored in Elasticsearch, making it an indispensable tool for any SOC analyst. Next, I'll be focusing on setting up a Windows server to act as a target machine for further exploration.
