## Introduction

On Day 2 of the 30-Days MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I delved into the ELK stack, a powerful trio of tools—Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana—widely used in security operations. Together, they form the backbone of log management and analysis, crucial for any Security Operations Center (SOC).

## Understanding Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is the heart of the stack. It's a robust search engine that stores and indexes massive amounts of log data. This data can range from Windows event logs to firewall logs and beyond. What makes Elasticsearch particularly valuable is its querying power. It uses Elasticsearch Query Language (ESQL), which allows users to search through large datasets quickly and efficiently. The flexibility of Elasticsearch, especially with its RESTful APIs and JSON support, means you can programmatically interact with it from other tools, enhancing its integration into diverse environments.

## The Power of Logstash

Next is Logstash, the powerhouse that processes and transforms incoming data before feeding it into Elasticsearch. Logstash is vital because it allows you to refine your log data, filtering out unnecessary information and only retaining what's critical. This reduces the load on Elasticsearch and helps you manage storage costs more effectively. Additionally, Logstash's ability to parse log fields is a game-changer. For example, you can extract specific details from logs, such as IP addresses, and map them to fields that can be easily queried later. This capability is crucial for security analysts who need to drill down into specific events during investigations.

## Visualizing with Kibana

Finally, Kibana is the interface where all the magic happens. It provides a user-friendly web console for querying data stored in Elasticsearch. Beyond simple querying, Kibana's visualization tools enable the creation of detailed dashboards that can display trends, alert patterns, and more. These dashboards are not only useful for real-time monitoring but also for reporting to executives, who often rely on visual data to understand security posture.

## Conclusion

The ELK stack offers centralized logging, customizable data processing, and scalable architecture, making it an essential tool for SOC analysts. Its integration with various telemetry sources and the ability to create visualizations make it a powerful platform for both real-time monitoring and incident response.

## Day 7 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Installing Elastic Agent and Setting Up Fleet Server

Welcome to Day 7 of the 30-Day My DFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, I took critical steps toward building a robust monitoring system by installing the Elastic Agent on a Windows Server and setting up a Fleet server for centralized management. This process is vital for SOC analysts to efficiently manage logs across multiple endpoints.

## Deploying the Fleet Server

I began with deploying an Ubuntu server to act as the Fleet server. This server plays a pivotal role by allowing me to manage multiple Elastic Agents from a single location. By centralizing the management of these agents, I can easily push updates, modify policies, and ensure all endpoints are correctly configured without needing to access each one individually.

## Setting Up in Kibana

Next, I moved into Kibana's interface, where I configured the Fleet server. This step involved generating enrollment tokens and policies that would allow the Elastic Agents to communicate securely with the Fleet server and Elasticsearch. In a real-world SOC environment, getting these configurations right is crucial, as they dictate how data flows between my endpoints and my central log management system.

## Overcoming Connectivity Challenges.

A key part of this process was troubleshooting connectivity issues. The initial setup ran into problems due to restrictive firewall rules that blocked the necessary communication between the Fleet server and the Elasticsearch instance. Adjusting both the VPC and server-level firewall rules allowed for the proper connections to be established. This scenario underscored the delicate balance I must strike between securing my systems and maintaining operational functionality.

## Installing the Elastic Agent on Windows Server

Once the Fleet server was configured, the next task was to install the Elastic Agent on my Windows Server. This agent is essential for collecting logs and metrics, and forwarding them to my Elasticsearch instance via the Fleet server. During this step, I encountered a few errors related to certificate validation and network connectivity. However, by utilizing the --insecure flag and ensuring the correct firewall ports were open, I successfully enrolled the Windows Server into the Fleet.

## Conclusion

Day 7 was all about setting up the infrastructure needed for effective log management. By successfully installing the Elastic Agent and configuring a Fleet server, I laid the groundwork for a scalable, manageable, and secure logging environment. In the next session, I'll dive deeper into system activity monitoring by installing Sysmon on my Windows Server, further enhancing my ability to detect and respond to threats.

# Day 4 of the 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge: Setting Up Kibana

## Overview

Today's focus was on setting up Kibana, a powerful data visualization tool. So I started by downloading Kibana from Elastic's website and installing it on my server. Once installed, I dove into configuring Kibana to ensure it was accessible from any device, not just the local host. This required updating the kibana.yml configuration file and replacing the default localhost setting with my server's public IP.

## Service Configuration

After configuration, I needed to ensure Kibana would start automatically whenever my server rebooted. This involved enabling and starting the Kibana service. Once everything was running, I verified the service status to confirm that it was active.

## Secure Connection to Elasticsearch

Next, I generated an Elasticsearch enrollment token, a crucial step for securely connecting Kibana to Elasticsearch. This token was stored safely for later use.

## Troubleshooting Access

While attempting to access Kibana through my browser, I encountered a connection timeout error. This led me to adjust my firewall settings both on Vultr, my cloud provider and on the Ubuntu server itself. Once these adjustments were made, I successfully accessed the Kibana web interface.

## Security Settings and Final Steps

Inside Kibana, I proceeded to configure security settings, adding encryption keys for saved objects to ensure data integrity and security. With everything set up and running smoothly, Kibana was fully operational, marking a successful completion of Day 4.

## Conclusion

This day was essential in setting up the foundation for future data analysis. Kibana is the gateway to visualizing and interacting with data stored in Elasticsearch, making it an indispensable tool for any SOC analyst. Next, I'll be focusing on setting up a Windows server to act as a target machine for further exploration.
